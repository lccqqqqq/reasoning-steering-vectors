I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which means the original assumption must be false. So, if I want to prove that sqrt(2) is irrational, I should start by assuming the opposite\u2014that sqrt(2) is rational.\n\nAlright, let me write that down. Let's say sqrt(2) is rational. That means sqrt(2) can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (because if they had common factors, we could simplify the fraction). So, sqrt(2) = a/b, where a and b are coprime integers, and b is not zero.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2.

So, if the original statement is \"If P, then Q,\" the contrapositive would be \"If not Q, then not P.\" And I also recall that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if I can prove the contrapositive, I've effectively proven the original statement.\n\nAlright, so let's define what P and Q are in this context. The original statement is \"If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" So here, P is \"n\u00b2 is even,\" and Q is \"n is even.\" That means the contrapositive would be \"If n is not even, then n\u00b2 is not even,\" or symbolically, \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right.

So in this case, since P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even,\" the contrapositive is \"If n is not even, then n\u00b2 is not even.\" That makes sense.\n\nSo, to prove the contrapositive, I need to show that if n is odd (i.e., not even), then n\u00b2 is also odd (i.e., not even). \n\nLet me recall some number theory here. I know that an even number can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer, and an odd number can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, let's assume n is not even, which means n is odd. Therefore, n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, let's compute n squared. If n = 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2. Let me expand that: (2k + 1)(2k + 1) = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.

Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, let me recall what irrational numbers are. From what I remember, irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.

So, these are numbers that can't be written as a simple ratio like 1/2, 3/4, etc.\n\nNow, the problem is asking about adding two irrational numbers and getting a rational result. That seems interesting because I know that adding two rational numbers gives another rational number, and adding two irrational numbers can sometimes give a rational number, but not always. For example, \u221a2 + (-\u221a2) is 0, which is rational. But \u221a2 + \u221a3 is irrational because their sum can't be expressed as a simple fraction. So, it depends on the numbers we're adding.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to prove is that there exist two irrational numbers whose sum is rational. The second part is to provide specific examples. Let's start with the proof.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can take two known irrational numbers and show that their sum is rational. But how do I ensure that their sum is rational? Perhaps if I can find two irrational numbers that are negatives of each other. For instance, like \u221a2 and -\u221a2. If I add them together, \u221a2 + (-\u221a2) equals 0, which is rational.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case? If I take two different irrationals, say \u221a2 and 1 - \u221a2, their sum would be 1, which is rational. So, in general, if I have an irrational number, its negative is also irrational because the additive inverse of a number has the same properties as the original number. So, if I take any irrational number a, and then take its negative, -a, then a + (-a) = 0, which is rational.\n\nTherefore, this seems like a general proof.

Let's start with the proof.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Let me think about how to approach this.[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"] Maybe I can take two known irrational numbers and show that their sum is rational.[\"end-section\"][\"uncertainty-estimation\"] But how do I ensure that their sum is rational?[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] Perhaps if I can find two irrational numbers that are negatives of each other.[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"] For instance, like \u221a2 and -\u221a2. If I add them together, \u221a2 + (-\u221a2) equals 0, which is rational.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"uncertainty-estimation\"]But wait, is that always the case?[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"] If I take two different irrationals, say \u221a2 and 1 - \u221a2, their sum would be 1, which is rational.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"] So, in general, if I have an irrational number, its negative is also irrational because the additive inverse of a number has the same properties as the original number.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So, if I take any irrational number a, and then take its negative, -a, then a + (-a) = 0, which is rational.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Therefore, this seems like a general proof.[\"end-section\"][\"initializing\"] Let me write this out: [\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Let a be an irrational number.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, when you have a statement that starts with '\u2200x' or '\u2200y', it's a universal quantifier, meaning it's saying something is true for all instances of that variable. Similarly, '\u2203y' is an existential quantifier, meaning there exists at least one instance where something is true.\n\nSo, the original statement is: For all x, there exists a y such that P(x) implies Q(y). In symbols, that's \u2200x\u2203y(P(x \u2192 Q(y)). My task is to find the negation of this statement.\n\nI recall that the negation of a quantifier flips the scope. So, the negation of \u2200x is \u2203x, and the negation of \u2203y is \u2200y. But I also remember that when you negate a statement with multiple quantifiers, you have to be careful with the order and the negation of the inner statement.\n\nLet me write down the original statement again for clarity: \u2200x\u2203y(P(x) \u2192 Q(y)). To negate this, I should negate the entire inner statement first and then flip the quantifiers.\n\nSo, the inner statement is P(x) \u2192 Q(y). The implication P(x) \u2192 Q(y) is logically equivalent to \u00acP(x) \u2228 Q(y). Therefore, the negation of this would be \u00ac(\u00acP(x) \u2228 Q(y)), which by De Morgan's laws becomes P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y).\n\nSo now, the negation of the inner statement is P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y). Now, since the original statement was \u2200x\u2203y(...), the negation will be \u2203x\u2200y(...).

Maybe I can consider different cases based on the relationship between a and b. \n\nFirst, what if a is equal to b? In that case, both max(a, b) and min(a, b) should be equal to a (or b, since they're the same). So, if a = b, then max(a, b) + min(a, b) would be a + a, which is 2a.

    "reasoning_chain": "Okay, so I need to prove that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers using the Well-Ordering Principle. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the Well-Ordering Principle is. I think it states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. Yeah, that sounds right. So, the idea is that in any set, there is something that is the smallest, and we can use that to prove things by induction or some kind of constructive proof.\n\nAlright, so the goal is to show that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes. That means for any positive integer n, there exist primes p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p_k such that n = p\u2081 \u00d7 p\u2082 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p_k. Let's see. I think this is related to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely into primes. But here, the question is to prove it using the Well-Ordering Principle, so I need to approach it that way.\n\nMaybe I can use induction. Induction is a common method where I prove the base case and then show that if it holds for some integer, it holds for the next one. Since we're dealing with positive integers, let's start with the smallest positive integer, which is 1. Hmm, but 1 is a special case because it's neither prime nor composite. So, how do we express 1 as a product of primes? Well, 1 can be thought of as the empty product, meaning that there are no primes multiplied together. So, maybe the theorem allows 1 to be expressed as an empty product, which is a convention in mathematics.\n\nOkay, so that works for n=1. Now, let's assume that every integer less than n can be expressed as a product of primes. I need to show that n itself can also be expressed as a product of primes. If n is a prime number, then by definition, it can be expressed as a single prime, so the base case holds for primes as well.\n\nWhat if n is composite? Then n can be written as a product of two integers greater than 1. Let me think. Since n is composite, there exist integers a and b such that 1 < a < b < n and n = a \u00d7 b. Now, from our induction hypothesis, both a and b are less than n and can",

The base case is where we verify the statement for n = 1. The inductive step is where we assume the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then we prove it must also be true for k + 1.\n\nAlright, let me start with the base case.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that if a number is divisible by 3, it means that when you divide it by 3, there's no remainder. In other words, n divided by 3 is an integer. So, n = 3k where k is some integer. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, if I square n, I get n\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2. Let me compute that. Squaring both sides, I get n\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2. So, n squared is 9 times k squared. \n\nWait, but 9 is obviously divisible by 3 because 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, 9k\u00b2 is 3 multiplied by 3k\u00b2. That means n\u00b2 is 3 times some integer, right? Because 3k\u00b2 is definitely an integer since both 3 and k\u00b2 are integers.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If n is divisible by 3, then n = 3k for some integer k. Then, n\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2, which factors into 3*(3k\u00b2).

The original statement is a universal assertion, meaning it's true for all real numbers. So I should probably use the universal quantifier symbol, which is usually written as \u2200.\n\nNext, let's break down the statement. An additive inverse of a number x is another number y such that x + y equals 0. So, for each real number x, there exists a y (which is the additive inverse) where x + y = 0.

Then, the statement \"Every real number has an additive inverse\" can be translated as: For all real numbers x, there exists a real number y such that AdditiveInverse(x, y) holds, and x + y = 0.\n\nPutting this together, the logical expression would use the universal quantifier for x (since it's every real number), and the existential quantifier for y (since it's there exists an inverse). So, the structure would be \u2200x\u2208\u211d, \u2203y\u2208\u211d, AdditiveInverse(x, y) \u2227 (x + y = 0).\n\nWait, but in first-order logic, we usually don't write the quantifiers with variables like x\u2208\u211d. Instead, we just write \u2200x P(x) where P(x) is a predicate. So perhaps I should define the predicate AdditiveInverse(x, y) to encompass both the existence of y and the equation x + y = 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it without a separate predicate. So, for each x in \u211d, there exists a y in \u211d such that y is the additive inverse of x. In that case, the statement becomes \u2200x\u2208\u211d, \u2203y\u2208\u211d, y = -x.

An additive inverse of a number x is another number y such that x + y equals 0.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So, for each real number x, there exists a y (which is the additive inverse) where x + y = 0.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] That means I need to express this relationship using a predicate.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"initializing\"]I'll start by defining a predicate, maybe something like AdditiveInverse(x, y), which means y is the additive inverse of x.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] Then, the statement \"Every real number has an additive inverse\" can be translated as: For all real numbers x, there exists a real number y such that AdditiveInverse(x, y) holds, and x + y = 0.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Putting this together, the logical expression would use the universal quantifier for x (since it's every real number), and the existential quantifier for y (since it's there exists an inverse).[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So, the structure would be \u2200x\u2208\u211d, \u2203y\u2208\u211d, AdditiveInverse(x, y) \u2227 (x + y = 0).[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"backtracking\"]Wait, but in first-order logic, we usually don't write the quantifiers with variables like x\u2208\u211d. Instead, we just write \u2200x P(x) where P(x) is a predicate.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So perhaps I should define the predicate AdditiveInverse(x, y) to encompass both the existence of y and the equation x + y = 0.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"backtracking\"]Alternatively, maybe I can express it without a separate predicate.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So, for each x in \u211d, there exists a y in \u211d such that y is the additive inverse of x.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] In that case, the statement becomes \u2200x\u2208\u211d, \u2203y\u2208\u211d, y = -x.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"] Because the additive inverse of x is -x.[\"end-section\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Yes, that makes sense.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"] So, I can rephrase the original statement as: For every real number x, there exists a real number y equal to -x[\"end-section\"]"

A rational number can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.

Let me explain why.\n\nIn number theory, if a prime number divides a square of a number, then it must divide the number itself. So, 3 is a prime number, and it divides a\u00b2, so 3 divides a.

I remember that mathematical induction is a common method for proofs like this, especially when dealing with statements that are supposed to be true for all positive integers. Alright, let me try to recall how induction works.\n\nFirst, there are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you check the statement for the initial value, usually n = 1. If the statement holds for n = 1, then you can proceed to the inductive step. In the inductive step, you assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then you try to show that it must also be true for k + 1.

For n = 1, the expression is 4^1 - 1, which is 4 - 1 = 3. Now, does 3 divide 3? Yes, because 3 divided by 3 is 1 with no remainder. So the base case holds.

So, it's a conditional statement where the antecedent is (P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)) and the consequent is Q.\n\nI think a good approach here is to construct a truth table for this statement.

Otherwise, it's true. The conjunction P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q) is only true when both P is true and (P \u2192 Q) is true. Since (P \u2192 Q) is true when either P is false or Q is true, so (P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)) would be true only when P is true and Q is true.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. If P is true, then (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to Q. So, if P is true, then (P \u2192 Q) is true if Q is true, and false if Q is false. Therefore, P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to P \u2227 Q, right? Because when P is true, (P \u2192 Q) is just Q. So, the conjunction would require both P and Q to be true",

    "reasoning_chain": "Alright, so I have to prove that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let me recall what rational and irrational numbers are. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers, and b is not zero. An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. Examples of irrational numbers include sqrt(2), pi, and e.\n\nSo, the statement I need to prove is: if I take a rational number and add an irrational number to it, the result is always irrational. Hmm, that makes sense intuitively because adding a precise, repeating or terminating decimal to a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal should mess up the pattern, right? But I need to prove it formally.\n\nLet me try to approach this by contradiction. That usually works well in proofs involving existence or non-existence. So, let's suppose the opposite of what we want to prove. That is, let's assume that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is rational. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then my original statement must be true.\n\nOkay, so let me denote the rational number as r and the irrational number as x. So, r is in Q (the set of rational numbers), and x is in R but not in Q (since it's irrational). The sum is r + x. Let's suppose that r + x is rational. Then, we can write r + x = s, where s is in Q.\n\nNow, if I subtract r from both sides of the equation, I get x = s - r. So, x is equal to the difference of two rational numbers. But both s and r are rational, and the difference of two rational numbers is also rational. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm: yes, because if s = a/b and r = c/d, then s - r = (ad - bc)/bd, which is still a rational number. So, if x is equal to s - r, then x would be rational, but that's a contradiction because x is supposed to be irrational.\n\nTherefore, my assumption that r + x is rational must be false.
