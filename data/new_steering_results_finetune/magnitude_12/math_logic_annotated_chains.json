Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some basic properties of even and odd numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, right? So, an even number is like 2, 4, 6, and so on. An odd number, then, is any integer that isn't even, like 1, 3, 5, etc. So, if n is even, it can be written as 2 times some integer, say k. So, n = 2k. Then, if I square that, n\u00b2 would be (2k)\u00b2, which is 4k\u00b2, which is obviously even because it's 2 times 2k\u00b2. That makes sense.\n\nBut the question is the other way around. If n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. So, I need to show that if n\u00b2 is even, n has to be even. Hmm, okay. Maybe I can use a proof by contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even\" is \"if n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd.\" So, if I can prove that if n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd, then that would be equivalent to proving the original statement. That seems like a good approach.\n\nAlright, so let's suppose that n is odd. Then, by definition, n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. That's the standard way to express an odd integer, right? So, n = 2k + 1. Then, let's compute n squared. n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2. Expanding that, we get 4k\u00b2 +",

So if you take any one of the primes, say Pk, and try to divide the new number by Pk, you get a remainder of 1, because P1*P2*...*Pk-1*Pk*...*Pn is divisible by Pk, and then adding 1 makes it so that when you divide by Pk, the remainder is 1. So, Pk can't divide the new number because it leaves a remainder. Therefore, the new number isn't divisible by any of the primes in the original list.\n\nSo, that means the new number must be a prime itself, right? But wait, if that's the case, then it's a prime not in the original list. That's a contradiction because the original list was supposed to include all primes. Therefore, our initial assumption that there are only finitely many primes must be wrong. So, there must be infinitely many primes.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

So maybe the statement is about integers greater than 1? Or maybe 1 is considered as the empty product, which is 1 by convention.

So, if I can list all the rational numbers in a sequence where each one can be associated with a natural number, then it's countable. \n\nBut how do I list all the rational numbers? They come in fractions, positive and negative, whole numbers too. Maybe I can separate them into positive and negative and handle them separately? Or maybe find a way to list them all in a grid or something. \n\nWait, I think there's a method where you arrange the rational numbers in a grid. Like, for each numerator and denominator, you have a pair. So, if I think of the integers as rows and columns, then each fraction is an element in the grid. But that might get too complicated because there are infinitely many rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the integers are countable. Since both the set of numerators and denominators are countable, their Cartesian product is also countable. But is that true? Because if you have two countable sets, their product is countable, so maybe that's a way to go. \n\nLet me recall, the set of integers is countably infinite, right? So, if I can pair each numerator with a natural number and each denominator with another natural number, then each fraction can be associated with a unique pair of natural numbers. Then, since the set of natural numbers is countable, the Cartesian product is also countable. \n\n",

Hmm, okay, so between any two real numbers, like if I pick any two numbers on the number line, there has to be at least one rational number in between them. That sounds familiar, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach proving it. Let me think about what I know.\n\nFirst, let's recall that real numbers include all the fractions and integers, and between any two real numbers, there are infinitely many other real numbers. But the question specifically asks about rational numbers. So, I need to show that no matter which two real numbers I pick, there will always be a rational number sitting between them. \n\nMaybe I can use the density of rational numbers? I remember that the rationals are dense in the real numbers, which means that between any two distinct real numbers, there are infinitely many rationals. But I think I need to construct an explicit example or use some theorem to prove it.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the decimal expansions? Because real numbers can be represented as decimals, and rational numbers have either terminating or repeating decimals. So, perhaps I can take two real numbers, convert them into their decimal forms, and then find a rational number in between by manipulating the decimals. But I'm not sure if that's the most straightforward way.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can use the concept of limits or sequences. If I have two real numbers, I can construct a sequence of rational numbers that converges to the average of the two numbers. But does that average necessarily lie between them?

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what these terms mean. \n\nFirst, I know that in logic, a statement is something that can be either true or false. If I have a statement like \"If P, then Q,\" that's called an implication. So, let's say my original statement is \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\" In logical terms, that would be P \u2192 Q, where P is \"it rains\" and Q is \"the ground is wet.\"\n\nNow, I remember that the contrapositive is another statement that is logically equivalent to the original implication. The contrapositive is formed by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion and negating both. So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Applying that to my example, the contrapositive would be \"If the ground is not wet, then it does not rain.\" That makes sense because if the ground isn't wet, it can't be because it rained. So, the contrapositive is kind of the reverse but with negations.\n\nNext, the inverse. Wait, is the inverse just the contrapositive of the converse? Or is it something else? Let me think. The inverse is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement. So, if the original is P \u2192 Q, the inverse would be \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. So, in my case, that would be \"If it does not rain, then the ground is not wet.\" Hmm, that seems different from the contrapositive.

I think the formula is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Yeah, that sounds right. But how do I actually prove that this formula is correct?\n\nOkay, so maybe I can try proving it by induction. Induction is a method where you prove the base case and then show that if it works for one case, it works for the next one. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the base case. Let's take n = 1.

Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because usually, when we say \"and\" in logic, it's a conjunction, which is a binary operator that requires both conditions to be true simultaneously. So, if someone writes \"P(x) and Q(x)\", that means P(x) is true and Q(x) is also true for the same x.\n\nBut the user wrote \"P(x) and Q(x)\", but in the original problem, it's written as \"There exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x)\". So, does that mean it's an existence statement where both P and Q are true for some x? Or is it that they are connected by \"and\" in the same existence statement?\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be \"There exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x)\" and another statement, but in the original problem, perhaps it's different. Wait, the user wrote: \"Show that there exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x)\" and \"Show that there exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x)\". Hmm, that seems redundant. Maybe the user meant to write two different statements, but both are the same.

The question is to prove that the square of any integer is congruent to 0, 1, or -1 modulo 4. Hmm, that's a common result in number theory. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall that any integer can be expressed in one of four forms when divided by 4: it can be congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. So, if I take an integer n, then n \u2261 0, 1, 2, or 3 mod 4. Then, I can square each of these cases and see what the result is modulo 4.\n\nLet's start with n \u2261 0 mod 4. If n is divisible by 4, then n = 4k for some integer k. Squaring both sides, we get n\u00b2 = (4k)\u00b2 = 16k\u00b2. Now, 16k\u00b2 is clearly divisible by 4, so n\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nNext, if n \u2261 1 mod 4, then n = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Squaring this, we have n\u00b2 = (4k + 1)\u00b2 = 16k\u00b2 + 8k + 1. Now, 16k\u00b2 is divisible by 4, and 8k is also divisible by 4, so n\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 4.\n\nMoving on, if n \u2261 2 mod 4, then n = 4k + 2. Squaring this, n\u00b2 = (4k + 2)\u00b2 = 16k\u00b2 + 16k + 4. Again, 16k\u00b2 and 16k are both divisible by 4, so n\u00b2 \u2261 4 mod 4, which simplifies to 0 mod ",

I need to prove that the square root of 3 is irrational. Hmm, I remember something about using proof by contradiction, where you assume the opposite and then show that it leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, let's start by assuming that the square root of 3 is rational. That means it can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common divisors other than 1, and b is not zero. So, \u221a3 = a/b.\n\nIf I square both sides, I get 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. Then, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2, I get 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. This implies that a\u00b2 is divisible by 3. If a\u00b2 is divisible by 3, then a must also be divisible by 3, right? Because if a prime number divides a square, it must divide the number itself.\n\nSo, let me write that down: a is divisible by 3. So, a = 3k for some integer k. Then, substituting back into the equation 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, I get 3b\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2. Dividing both sides by 3, we have b\u00b2 = 3k\u00b2. This means that b\u00b2 is divisible by 3, and hence, b is also divisible by 3.\n\nBut wait, if both a and b are divisible by 3, that means they have a common divisor of 3, which contradicts our initial assumption that a and b have no common divisors other than 1. This contradiction implies that our original assumption that \u221a3 is rational must be false. Therefore, \u221a3 is irrational.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, combining these two, if x is in A, then it's in B because A is a subset of B, and since B is a subset of C, x must also be in C. Therefore, A is a subset of C. Wait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should write it more formally.\n\nLet me recall the definitions. The subset relation is transitive. That is, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. This is one of the axioms in set theory. So, maybe I don't need to prove it, but the problem is asking me to prove it.

Maybe I should start by recalling the definitions. In set theory, the complement of a set A, denoted by ~A, is the set of all elements not in A. So, if I have two sets A and B, their complements ~A and ~B would be the sets of elements not in A and not in B, respectively.\n\nNow, the question is about the relationship between the complement of the union of two sets and the intersection of their complements. I think there's a theorem related to this. Isn't it the De Morgan's Law? Yeah, that's right. De Morgan's Laws state that for any two sets A and B, the complement of their union is equal to the intersection of their complements, and the complement of their intersection is equal to the union of their complements.\n\nSo, in symbols, that would be:\n\n~ (A \u222a B) = ~A \u2229 ~B\n\nand\n\n~ (A \u2229 B) = ~A \u222a ~B\n\nSince the question is about the complement of the union, it's the first equation. Therefore, the complement of (A \u222a B) is equal to the intersection of ~A and ~B.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with a Venn diagram to make sure I understand. Imagine two overlapping circles representing sets A and B. The union A \u222a B would be everything in either circle. The complement of that would be everything outside both circles. On the other hand, the intersection of ~A and ~B would also be everything outside both A and B, which is the same as the complement of the union. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more formally. Let's define what it means for an element to be in the complement of (A \u222a B).

Let me try to think through this step by step. So, the problem is about set theory, specifically about subsets. The question is: Given two sets A and B, prove that if A is a subset of B, then the power set of A is a subset of the power set of B. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a subset is. If A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. So, A \u2286 B. Now, the power set of a set is the set of all subsets of that set. So, P(A) is the set of all subsets of A, and P(B) is the set of all subsets of B.\n\nSo, the statement is that if every element of A is in B, then every subset of A is also a subset of B. That makes sense intuitively because if every element in A is in B, then any collection of elements from A would also be a collection of elements from B. Therefore, every subset of A should be a subset of B. But I need to formalize this thought process.\n\nLet me start by taking an arbitrary element of P(A) and show that it must also be an element of P(B). So, let\u2019s say S is an element of P(A). By definition, S is a subset of A. Since A is a subset of B, that means every element in S is also in B. Therefore, S is also a subset of B. Hence, S is in P(B). Since S was an arbitrary element of P(A), this shows that every element of P(A) is also in P(B). Therefore, P(A) is a subset of P(B).\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is by using the definitions. A set A is a subset of B if for all x, x \u2208",

If I add a rational number and an irrational number, is the result always irrational? Let me think. I remember that a rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. An irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction. So, for example, \u221a2 is irrational.\n\nIf I add a rational number like 1/2 and \u221a2, what do I get? That should be irrational, right? Because \u221a2 is irrational and 1/2 is rational, their sum should be irrational. But wait, is that always the case? What if I add a rational number to an irrational number? Let me test with another example. Let's say I have \u221a2 and 3, which is rational. Adding them together gives \u221a2 + 3, which is still irrational. So, it seems like adding a rational and an irrational number always results in an irrational number.\n\nBut I'm not sure if there's a case where it could be rational. Maybe if the irrational number is negative? Let's try. If I have -\u221a2 and 1, which is rational. Then, -\u221a2 + 1 is still irrational. Hmm, so it seems like regardless of whether the irrational number is positive or negative, adding a rational number to it will keep it irrational.\n\nWait, but what about adding zero? If I add zero, which is rational, to an irrational number, I should still get an irrational number. Because zero is rational, and adding it to an irrational shouldn't make it rational. That makes sense because zero is just a number, it doesn't change the nature of the number it's being added to.\n\nIs there a mathematical proof for this? I think so.
