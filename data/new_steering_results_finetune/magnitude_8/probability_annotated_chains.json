            "steered_chain": "<\uff5cUser\uff5c>In a class of 30 students, each student is randomly assigned to one of 5 project groups. What is the probability that exactly 7 students are assigned to group #1?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nWait, so I have this problem here: In a class of 30 students, each student is randomly assigned to one of five project groups. I need to find the probability that exactly 7 students are assigned to group #1. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I think this is a probability question involving combinations and maybe permutations. Since the students are being assigned randomly, each student has an equal chance of going into any of the five groups. So, for each student, the probability of being assigned to group #1 is 1/5, right? Because there are five groups, so each has a 1/5 chance.\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that exactly 7 out of 30 students are assigned to group #1. Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a binomial probability problem. In binomial problems, we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each student can be considered a trial, and being assigned to group #1 is a \"success,\" while being assigned to any other group is a \"failure.\"\n\nSo, the formula for binomial probability is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k successes,\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial,\n- n is the total number of trials.\n\nIn this problem, n is 30 because there are 30 students. k is 7 because we want exactly 7 students in group #1. p is 1/5 since each student has a 1/5 chance of being assigned to group #1.\n\nSo plugging those values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(7) = C(30, 7) * (1",

What is the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes?\" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with probability problems involving multiple trials, especially with a fixed number of successes, the binomial probability formula is usually the way to go. So, yeah, this sounds like a binomial distribution problem.\n\nAlright, so the binomial probability formula is given by P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where:\n- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial,\n- and n is the total number of trials.\n\nIn this case, rolling a die is a trial, and getting a six is a success. Since it's a fair die, the probability of success on each trial is 1/6, so p = 1/6. The number of trials is 10, so n = 10, and we want exactly 3 sixes, so k = 3.\n\nAlright, so plugging in the numbers, I need to calculate C(10, 3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^(10-3). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the combination C(10, 3). I remember that the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial. So, C(10, 3) is 10! / (3! * 7!). Calculating that:\n\n10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7!, so when we divide by 7",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, there are 13 hearts in the deck. The problem is about drawing 5 cards and getting exactly 3 of them being hearts. I need to find the probability of this happening.\n\nProbability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out two things: how many ways can I draw 5 cards with exactly 3 hearts, and how many ways can I draw any 5 cards from the deck.\n\nLet me start with the total number of possible outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52. That's a combination problem, right? So, I can use combinations here because the order doesn't matter when drawing the cards. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw 5 cards is C(52, 5).

I need to draw 4 marbles, specifically 2 red, 2 blue, and 0 green.

The first person to flip heads wins. Alice goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Alice wins the game. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the game. They have a fair coin, so the probability of getting heads on any flip is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5. Alice goes first, so she flips the coin. If she gets heads, she wins immediately. If she gets tails, then Bob gets a turn to flip. If Bob gets heads, he wins; if he also gets tails, then it goes back to Alice, and so on.\n\nSo, it's like a sequence of independent events where each flip is a Bernoulli trial with a probability of success (heads) being 0.5 each time. The game continues until someone gets a head.\n\nI think this is similar to a geometric distribution problem, where we're looking for the probability that the first success (head) occurs on the first, third, fifth, etc., trial. But in this case, it's a turn-based game, so each player has their own trials.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the probability that Alice wins the game as P.\n\nSo, the first flip is Alice's. She can either get heads or tails.\n\nCase 1: Alice flips heads. The probability of this is 0.5, and in this case, she wins. So, that's 0.5 * 1 (since she wins).\n\nCase 2: Alice flips tails. The probability here is 0.5. Then, Bob gets to flip. If Bob flips heads, he wins, so Alice loses. The probability of that is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So, Alice loses in this case.\n\nCase 3",

Hmm, sounds like it's related to conditional probability. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the test has a 98% chance of correctly identifying someone who has the disease. That sounds like the test's sensitivity. So, if someone actually has the disease, the probability that the test correctly identifies it is 98%. That means the probability of a false negative, where the test misses the disease, is 2%, right? Because 100% minus 98% is 2%.\n\nSimilarly, the problem states that the test has a 95% chance of correctly identifying someone who doesn't have the disease. That must be the test's specificity. So, if someone doesn't have the disease, the test correctly says they don't, 95% of the time. That means the probability of a false positive, where the test incorrectly says they do have the disease, is 5%. Because 100% minus 95% is 5%.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that 2% of the population has the disease. I think that means the prevalence of the disease in the population is 2%.

Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with probability, especially with dice, it's often helpful to figure out the total number of possible outcomes and then the number of favorable outcomes. The probability would then be the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes.\n\nSo, for a single die, there are 6 possible outcomes, right? Each die has numbers 1 through 6. Since we're rolling three dice, I think the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by itself three times. Let me write that down: 6 * 6 * 6. That would be 6^3, which is 216. So, there are 216 possible outcomes when rolling three dice.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how many of these outcomes result in the sum of 10. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the number of ways three numbers, each between 1 and 6, can add up to 10. This is a combinatorial problem, I think.\n\nI remember that this is similar to the problem of finding the number of integer solutions to the equation a + b + c = 10, where each of a, b, c is at least 1 and at most 6. Because each die must show at least 1 and at most 6.\n\nI think the formula for this is something like combinations with restrictions. Maybe I can use stars and bars or something.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand the total number of possible lottery tickets and then the number of favorable outcomes where exactly three numbers match. So, the total number of possible tickets is the number of ways to choose 6 numbers out of 49, right? That's a combination problem because the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, the total number of possible tickets is C(49, 6).\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need to find how many ways I can have exactly three numbers that are the same and the other three are different. So, I think I need to choose 3 numbers out of the 49 to be the matched ones, and then choose the remaining 3 numbers from the remaining 46 numbers. So, that would be C(49, 3) * C(46, 3). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I choose the three correct numbers, I have C(49, 3) ways, and then for each of those, I choose the remaining three numbers from the 46 that weren't chosen initially. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is C(49, 3) * C(46, 3), and the total possible outcomes are C(49, 6). Therefore, the probability is [C(49, 3) * C(46, 3)] / C(49, 6).

I need to figure out the probability that if I select 4 bulbs at random, at least one of them is defective. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when it comes to probabilities involving \"at least one,\" it might be easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting it from 1. So, the opposite of selecting at least one defective bulb is selecting no defective bulbs at all. That makes sense because it's simpler to compute the probability of the opposite and then subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, let me write that down. The probability of selecting at least one defective bulb is equal to 1 minus the probability of selecting no defective bulbs. So, P(at least one defective) = 1 - P(no defective). That seems right.\n\nNow, I need to figure out P(no defective). That would mean all 4 bulbs I select are good. Since there are 10 bulbs in total and 3 are defective, that means there are 10 - 3 = 7 good bulbs.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 4 good bulbs from 7 is a combination problem. I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're just selecting bulbs. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 4 good bulbs is C(7, 4).

It says the coin has a 0.6 probability of landing heads and I need to find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads when flipping it 8 times. Hmm, okay. I remember something about this from probability class, maybe binomial probability?\n\nLet me think. So, when dealing with coins, each flip is an independent event, right? So, getting heads on one flip doesn't affect the next. That sounds like a binomial distribution. Yeah, binomial probability formula is something like C(n, k) times p to the k, times (1-p) to the (n-k). Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\nSo, in this case, n is 8 because we're flipping the coin 8 times. K is 5 because we want exactly 5 heads. The probability of getting heads is 0.6, so p is 0.6, and the probability of getting tails is 1 - p, which is 0.4.\n\nOkay, so plugging into the formula: C(8,5) times (0.6)^5 times (0.4)^(8-5). Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate C(8,5). I remember that combinations can be calculated with the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, 8! divided by (5! times 3!). Let me compute that.\n\n8 factorial is 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, but since in the denominator we have 5! and 3!, some terms will cancel out.

Hmm, this sounds familiar. I think it's related to the pigeonhole principle or something like that. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that there are 365 days in a year, right? So each person can have a birthday on any one of those days. If we're talking about the probability that at least two people share a birthday, it's the opposite of all 23 people having unique birthdays. So maybe I can calculate the probability of all birthdays being unique and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least two sharing.\n\nOkay, so to calculate the probability that all birthdays are unique, I need to figure out how many possible ways there are for 23 people to have unique birthdays and then divide that by the total number of possible birthday combinations.\n\nThe total number of possible birthday combinations for 23 people is 365 choices for the first person, 364 for the second, 363 for the third, and so on, down to 343 for the 23rd person.

That should give me the probability.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, the total number of ways to draw four cards from the deck. Since the order doesn't matter in drawing cards, this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to draw four cards is 52 choose 4.

Let me try to figure out the probability that it rains on three consecutive days. So, if it rains today, what's the chance it rains tomorrow, and then the day after, and the day after that? Hmm.\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. The problem says that in a certain city, it rains on 30% of the days. So, the probability that it rains on any given day is 30%, or 0.3. That means the probability that it does not rain on a day is 70%, or 0.7.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that it rains for three consecutive days. So, I think we need to calculate the probability that it rains today, tomorrow, and the day after that. Since each day is independent, the probability of multiple events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nWait, are the days independent? The problem doesn't specify any dependence between the days, so I think we can assume that each day is independent. So, the probability of rain on each day doesn't affect the probability of rain on the next day.\n\nSo, if it rains today, what's the probability it rains tomorrow? Hmm, the problem doesn't directly say. It only gives the overall probability of rain on any given day, which is 30%. So, is the rain a 30% chance each day, regardless of the previous days? If that's the case, then each day is independent.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it rains on three consecutive days would be the product of the probability of rain each day. So, that would be 0.3 multiplied by 0.3 multiplied by 0.3, which is 0.027, or 2.7%.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, let me think. A full house is when you have three cards of one rank and two of another rank. Okay, so I know that in probability, the formula is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let me recall how many total possible five-card hands there are. A standard deck has 52 cards. So the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is the combination of 52 choose 5, which is written as C(52,5). I remember that the formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, calculating that, 52! divided by 5! times 47!, which is a big number, but I don't need to compute it exactly right now, I can just keep it as C(52,5) for the denominator.\n\nNow, for the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes, meaning the number of five-card hands that form a full house. So, how do I calculate that? Well, I think it's about choosing the rank first and then the suits.\n\nIn a standard deck, there are 13 ranks (Ace through King) and each rank has 4 suits. For a full house, I need three cards of one rank and two of another. So first, I need to choose which rank is going to be the one with three cards, and then which rank is going to be the one with two cards.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the rank for the three-of-a-kind is 13, since there are 13 possible ranks. Once I've chosen the rank for the three-of-a-kind, I need to choose the rank for the pair. Since one rank is already chosen, there are 12 remaining ranks. So that's 13 times ",

When rolling two six-sided dice, each die has numbers 1 through 6, and the total number of possible outcomes is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\). So, the sample space has 36 equally likely outcomes.\n\nNow, let's tackle the denominator first, which is \\( P(B) \\): the probability that the sum of the two dice is at least 10.

What is the probability that all three points lie on the same semi-circle?\" Hmm, okay. I remember something about this from geometry, but I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. Imagine a circle, and I'm going to randomly pick three points on its edge. I need to find the probability that all three points lie within a semi-circle. Hmm, so a semi-circle is half the circumference, right? So, is there a way to measure the chance that all three points are within 180 degrees of each other?\n\nI think a good starting point is to fix one point because the circle is symmetrical. If I fix one point, say point A, then the positions of the other two points, B and C, can be measured relative to A. That might simplify things because fixing a point doesn't affect the probability.\n\nSo, let's fix point A at angle 0 degrees on the circumference. Now, points B and C will have angles \u03b8 and \u03c6, where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are between 0 and 360 degrees. But since the circle is continuous, I can represent these angles as points on a number line from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to 360 degrees. That might make calculations easier because dealing with fractions instead of degrees can sometimes be simpler.\n\nSo, let me define \u03b8 and \u03c6 as two independent uniform random variables on the interval [0, 1). The question then becomes: what is the probability that both \u03b8 and \u03c6 lie within a semi-circle starting from point A, which is at 0.\n\nBut wait, actually, the semi-circle can be anywhere on the circle, not necessarily starting at A.

What is the expected number of trials needed until the first success occurs?\" Hmm, I think this is about expected value for a geometric distribution. Let me recall what I know about geometric distributions.\n\nFirst, the geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. Each trial has two outcomes: success or failure, with the probability of success being p and failure being 1-p. In this case, the probability of success is 0.3, so p=0.3 and the probability of failure q=0.7.\n\nI remember that the expected value, often denoted as E[X], for a geometric distribution is given by the formula E[X] = 1/p. Wait, is that right? Let me think. So if p is the probability of success, then on average, we would expect to have to try p times before getting a success. That seems a bit counterintuitive because if p is 0.3, we might expect it to take longer than 1 trial on average. But according to the formula, it's 1/p, so 1 divided by 0.3, which is 10/3, approximately 3.333 trials. That makes sense because if each trial is independent and the chance of success is low, it would take more trials on average.\n\nBut let me try to derive this expectation from scratch to make sure I'm not just recalling it incorrectly. Maybe I can use the definition of expected value. The expected value E[X] is the sum over all possible values of x multiplied by their probabilities. So, for a geometric distribution, the probability mass function is P(X = k) = (1 - p)^(k-1) * p, where k is the trial number where the first",

It says: \"A box contains 15 chips: 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green, and 3 yellow. You randomly select 3 chips without replacement. What is the probability that you select exactly one red chip and exactly one blue chip?\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of chips in the box. Let's see: 5 red + 4 blue + 3 green + 3 yellow. That adds up to 5 + 4 is 9, plus 3 is 12, plus another 3 is 15. So, there are 15 chips in total.\n\nWe need to select 3 chips without replacement. So, the total number of possible ways to select 3 chips from 15 is the combination of 15 choose 3, which is written as C(15,3). I remember that the formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial. So, C(15,3) is 15! / (3! * 12!) which simplifies to (15 * 14 * 13) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 455. So, there are 455 possible ways to pick any 3 chips.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of selecting exactly one red chip and exactly one blue chip. So, that means out of the 3 chips, 1 is red, 1 is blue, and the remaining 1 chip should be either green or yellow.

There are ten balls, each with a unique number from 1 to 10. I need to draw three of them without putting any back into the bag once I draw them. So, the total number of possible ways to draw three balls is the combination of 10 choose 3, right? Which is calculated as 10! divided by (3! * (10-3)!).

When does a sum of numbers become even? I remember that the sum is even if there are an even number of odd numbers in the sum. So, for three numbers, the sum is even if there are 0 odd numbers or 2 odd numbers because 0 is even and 2 is even. Wait, hold on, 0 is even, but if all three are even, that's 0 odd numbers, which is even, so that's one case. If there's 1 odd and 2 even numbers, that's also an odd sum? Wait, no, let me think.

Using a balance scale, what is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the counterfeit coin with certainty?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nWait, so I have this problem where there's a box with 8 identical-looking coins, and I need to figure out which one is counterfeit. The catch is that the counterfeit coin is lighter than the real ones. I remember hearing about these types of problems before, where you have to determine a fake coin with a balance scale. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method. Let me try to think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a balance scale can compare two groups of coins and tell me which side is heavier, lighter, or if they're equal. Since all the coins look the same, the only way to find the counterfeit is by their weight. The counterfeit is lighter, so wherever it is, that side will be lighter if I group them correctly.\n\nHmm, so with 8 coins, how should I start? I think the key is to divide them into groups and compare. If I can eliminate half each time, I can narrow it down quickly. Let me recall, for a balance scale, each weighing can give me three outcomes: left heavier, right heavier, or balanced. That means each weighing can give me some information, which is like a base-3 system.\n\nWait, so if I have 8 coins, and each weighing can give me 3 possibilities, then how many weighings do I need to cover all possibilities? I think it's logarithmic. The formula is something like log base 3 of the number of items. So log3(8) is approximately 2, but since we can't do a fraction of a weighing, we need to round up. So maybe 2 weighings? But that doesn't seem right because with 2 weighings, I can only distinguish between 9 possibilities, which is 3^2. Since 8 is less than 9, maybe 2 weighings are enough. But wait, let me think about how that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach",

So, each person has to choose from 1 to 10 floors, right? But the question is asking for the probability that all five people exit on different floors. Hmm, okay, so it's like each person is selecting a unique floor, and we want all of them to have different choices. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many ways all five can choose different floors, and then divide that by the total number of ways they can choose any floors. \n\nFirst, let me figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Since each person has 10 choices (floors 1 through 10), and they choose independently, the total number of possible combinations is 10 multiplied by itself five times. So that's 10^5, which is 100,000. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways all five can choose different floors. So, the first person has 10 choices. The second person has to choose a different floor than the first, so that would be 9 choices. The third person has 8 choices, the fourth person 7, and the fifth person 6. So, that's 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6. Let me calculate that: 10 \u00d7 9 is 90, 90 \u00d7 8 is 720, 720 \u00d7 7 is 5040, 5040 \u00d7 6 is 30,240.

So, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nOkay, so there's a game show where there are three doors. Behind one door is a car, and the other two have goats. The contestant picks one door, thinking maybe it's the car. Then the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a goat.

The question is, should they switch or not?\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the probability of winning the car by switching versus staying with the initial choice. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's imagine the contestant picks a door. The probability that the contestant picks the car on the first try is 1/3. That makes sense because there are three doors, only one has the car. So, the chance is 1/3.\n\nIf the contestant picks the car, then the host has two doors to open, both of which have goats. The host can open either one; it doesn't matter which one because they both have goats. So, in this scenario, if the contestant sticks with their initial choice, they win. The probability here is 1/3.\n\nNow, if the contestant doesn't pick the car, which is also a 2/3 probability, then the host will open the door with the goat. So, in this case, the contestant's initial choice was wrong, and the remaining unopened door must have the car. So, if the contestant switches, they can win the car.

There's a group with 5 men and 4 women, so total people are 5 + 4 = 9. We need to form a committee of 3 people, and we want the probability that this committee has at least 2 women.

So, I need to calculate both the total number of ways to form the committee and the number of committees with at least 2 women.\n\nLet me start with the total number of possible committees. Since the order doesn't matter in a committee, this is a combination problem. The total number of ways to choose 3 people from 9 is C(9,3). I remember the combination formula is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers: C(9,3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84.

The goal is to figure out the optimal strategy to maximize the expected value of your final score. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. You have a six-sided die, fair, so each face from 1 to 6 has an equal probability of 1/6. You can roll it once, and then decide whether to keep that number or roll again. If you decide to roll again, you repeat the process. The question is, what should your strategy be to maximize the expected value of the number you end up with?\n\nI think this is similar to the \"optimal stopping problem\" or maybe the \"secretary problem,\" but with a die instead of a sequence of candidates. In the secretary problem, you interview candidates one by one and have to decide when to stop to maximize the chance of picking the best candidate. But here, instead of a sequence, we have a random variable each time, and we can decide whether to keep it or not.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let\u2019s denote E as the expected value of the final outcome when following the optimal strategy. When we roll the die, we get a number X, which can be 1 through 6, each with probability 1/6. If we choose to keep X, our expected value is just X. If we choose to roll again, the expected value would be E, because we're essentially restarting the process.\n\nSo, for each possible outcome of the first roll, we need to decide whether to keep it or roll again.

I remember something about the pigeonhole principle here, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nSo, if there are 365 days in a year, and we have n people, each person has a birthday on one of these days. The probability that at least two people share a birthday is what we need to calculate.\n\nI recall that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday can be found using the complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability that at least two share a birthday, it's easier to calculate the probability that all birthdays are unique and then subtract that from 1.\n\nSo, the probability that all birthdays are unique is equal to the number of ways to assign unique birthdays divided by the total number of possible birthday combinations. Since each person can have any birthday, the total number of possible birthday combinations is 365^n.\n\nThe number of ways to assign unique birthdays is the number of permutations of 365 days taken n at a time, which is 365Pn or 365! / (365 - n)!.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all birthdays are unique is 365Pn / 365^n.\n\nSo, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 - (365Pn / 365^n).\n\nWe need this probability to be greater than 0.5.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. So, for three terms, if the first term is 'a' and the common ratio is 'r', the three terms would be a, ar, and ar\u00b2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with dice, each die can roll a number from 1 to 6.

That means I need to find all possible triplets (a, b, c) such that b = a * r and c = b * r, where a, b, c are integers from 1 to 6, and r is a rational number because we're dealing with integers. \n\nWait, hold on, actually, since a, b, c are integers, r doesn't necessarily have to be an integer. For example, if a is 2, and r is 1/2, then b would be 1, and c would be 0.5, but c has to be an integer between 1 and 6, so 0.5 isn't allowed. So, r must be a rational number such that both ar and ar\u00b2 are integers. That makes it a bit tricky.\n\nLet me think about possible ratios. The ratio r could be a fraction or an integer. Let's consider different cases.\n\nCase 1: The common ratio is an integer. So, r is 2, 3, etc. Let's see:\n\nIf r = 2:\n- Then a must be such that ar\u00b2 <=6. So, a must be",

That means I need to calculate the average position of the first ace in the deck.\n\nWait, is that right? Or is it the expected number of cards drawn until the first ace appears? So, for example, if the first card is an ace, then we've drawn 1 card. If the first ace is on the second card, we've drawn 2, and so on, up to the 52nd card, which would be the last card. So, yeah, the expectation would be the average of these possible positions.\n\nI remember something about expectation and maybe it relates to probability. Maybe I can model this as a geometric distribution? Let me think. In a geometric distribution, the expected value is 1/p, where p is the probability of success. In this case, the \"success\" would be drawing an ace, right? So, the probability of success on each trial is 4/52, since there are 4 aces in the deck. That simplifies to 1/13.

What is the probability that the top 13 cards contain exactly 4 aces?\" Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I think I need to use combinatorics here because it's about combinations of cards.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. We have a standard deck of 52 cards, and when it's shuffled, it's random. So, any card can be anywhere in the deck with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that when we look at the first 13 cards, there are exactly 4 aces in there.\n\nSo, to rephrase, out of the 52 cards, the first 13 have exactly 4 aces, and the remaining 39 have none. Hmm, right? So, we need to find how likely it is that in the top 13, exactly 4 are aces.\n\nI think this is a hypergeometric probability problem. Because we're dealing with successes (aces) and failures (non-aces) without replacement. So, the hypergeometric distribution gives the probability of k successes in n draws without replacement from a finite population.\n\nLet me recall the formula for hypergeometric probability:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the total number of items in the population (here, 52 cards),\n- K is the number of success states in the population (number of aces, which is 4),\n- n is the number of draws (the top 13 cards),\n- k is the number of observed successes (4 aces).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nN = 52\nK = 4\nn = 13\nk = 4\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nP = [C(4",

Each ball is independently placed, and each bin is equally likely to receive any ball. I need to find the probability that exactly one bin remains empty. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probability problems involving distributing objects into containers, it often involves combinations and sometimes the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, let me recall that. The total number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n$$\n\nBut wait, in this case, the balls are being placed into bins, and each ball is independent, so does that mean they are distinguishable? Or are they indistinct? Hmm, the problem says \"five balls are randomly placed,\" so I think each ball is independent, but since they are being placed into bins, each bin is equally likely. So, maybe each ball has an equal probability of going into any bin. So, actually, each ball is placed into a bin uniformly at random, and the placements are independent.\n\nWait, so each ball has five choices, so the total number of possible distributions is 5^5, since each of the five balls can go into any of the five bins. So, total possible outcomes are 5^5, which is 3125. That seems right.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of distributions where exactly one bin is empty. So, we need to count the number of ways to distribute five balls into five bins such that exactly one bin has zero balls and the other four bins have at least one ball each.\n\nSo, to compute this, maybe it's similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle for surjective functions.

I need to find the probability of hitting the target at least 8 times. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, this sounds like a binomial probability problem because we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: hit or miss. The probability of success (hitting the target) is constant at 0.7 for each shot.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n- p is the probability of success.\n- n is the total number of trials.\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this case, n is 10 because the shooter takes 10 shots. We need the probability of getting at least 8 hits, which means 8, 9, or 10 hits. So, I need to calculate P(8) + P(9) + P(10).\n\nFirst, let me compute each term separately.\n\nStarting with P(8):\n\nC(10, 8) is the number of ways to choose 8 hits out of 10 shots. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, C(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * (10 - 8)!) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = (10*9)/(2*1) = 45.\n\nThen, p^k is 0.7^8, and (1-p)^(n - k) is 0.3^(10 - 8) = 0.3^2.\n\nSo, P(8) = 45 * (0",

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a three-digit number is formed by selecting three different digits from 1 to 9. So, the total number of possible three-digit numbers we can form is the number of permutations of 9 digits taken 3 at a time. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, plugging in the numbers here, that would be P(9, 3) = 9! / (9 - 3)! = 9! / 6!. Calculating that, 9! is 362880 and 6! is 720, so 362880 / 720 equals 504. So, there are 504 possible three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these numbers are divisible by 3.

So, the key here is to figure out how many three-digit numbers formed by distinct digits from 1 to 9 have a digit sum that's a multiple of 3.\n\nTo do this, maybe I can think about the remainders when each digit (1 through 9) is divided by 3. Since we're dealing with divisibility by 3, modular arithmetic might help here. Each digit from 1 to 9 can be categorized based on their remainder when divided by 3.

At first glance, it seems a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me try to figure it out.\n\nOkay, so the die has six sides, numbers 1 through 6. If I roll a 1, I lose $5. If I roll a 6, I win $10. For the other numbers, 2, 3, 4, or 5, I guess I get to roll again. So, this sounds like an expected value problem where each outcome has a probability, and I need to calculate the expected value of the game.\n\nI remember that the expected value (EV) is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing them all up. So, in this case, I need to figure out the probability of each outcome leading to a win or loss, and then compute the expected value based on that.\n\nLet me write down the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Roll a 1: lose $5\n2. Roll a 2: roll again\n3. Roll a 3: roll again\n4. Roll a 4: roll again\n5. Roll a 5: roll again\n6. Roll a 6: win $10\n\nSince each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of being rolled, each has a probability of 1/6.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probability, it often helps to figure out the total number of possible outcomes and then the number of favorable outcomes. So, for three dice, each die has 6 faces, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice would be 6 multiplied by itself three times, which is 6^3. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36, and 36 * 6 is 216. So, there are 216 possible outcomes in total. Got that down.\n\nNow, the problem is asking about the probability that the largest number appears exactly once. So, I need to find how many outcomes have exactly one die showing the highest number, and the other two dice showing numbers less than that. Hmm, okay.

But wait, if all three dice show 1, then the largest number is 1, but in that case, all three dice are the same. So, does that count as the largest number appearing exactly once? Hmm, actually, no.

Hmm, this sounds like a classic probability question, maybe involving conditional probability. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words. There's a virus scanner, and it's not perfect. When it scans a file, there's a 99% chance it correctly identifies a virus if one is present. That means it has a 1% chance of missing a virus. Also, if there's no virus, the scanner has a 2% chance of incorrectly flagging it as a virus. So, the scanner can be wrong in two ways: either it misses a real virus or it incorrectly flags a clean file as having a virus.\n\nThe question is asking: If the scanner says a file has a virus, what's the probability that the file actually does have a virus? In probability terms, this is asking for P(Virus | Positive), which is the probability of having a virus given a positive result.\n\nAlright, so I remember that for conditional probability, the formula is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, A is the event that the file has a virus, and B is the event that the scanner detects a virus.

I need to figure out the probability that if I take a random sample of 50 records, exactly 2 of them will be corrupted. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of selecting certain items without replacement, combinations come into play. Since the order in which I select the records doesn't matter, combinations are probably the right way to go. So, I think I should use the combination formula here.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 50 records out of 1000 is given by the combination formula C(1000, 50). Similarly, the number of ways to choose exactly 2 corrupted records out of the 10 available is C(10, 2). Then, the number of ways to choose the remaining 48 non-corrupted records from the 990 non-corrupted ones is C(990, 48). \n\nSo, the probability should be the product of these two combinations divided by the total number of ways to choose the 50 records, right? That is, Probability = [C(10, 2) * C(990, 48)] / C(1000, 50). \n\nWait, let me make sure I got that straight. So, C(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k items from n without considering order.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The buses come every 15 minutes starting at noon. So, the first bus is at 12:00, the next at 12:15, then 12:30, 12:45, 1:00, and so on. Now, a passenger arrives at the bus stop at a random time between 12:00 and 1:00.

We have ten identical balls and nine distinct boxes. Each ball is placed into a box randomly with equal probability. So, each ball has a 1/9 chance to go into any box. We need to find the probability that exactly one box has exactly two balls, and all the other boxes have either one ball or none. In other words, out of the ten balls, one box has two, and the remaining eight balls are distributed among the other eight boxes, each having at most one ball.\n\nOkay, so how do I approach this? Well, probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find the number of ways to distribute the balls such that exactly one box has two balls, and the rest have at most one, and then divide that by the total number of ways to distribute the balls without any restrictions.\n\nFirst, let me compute the total number of ways to distribute ten identical balls into nine distinct boxes. Since each ball can go into any box independently, this is equivalent to the number of functions from the set of balls to the set of boxes, which is 9^10. So, the total number of possible distributions is 9^10.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: the number of ways where exactly one box has two balls, and the other eight boxes have at most one ball each.

It's about probability, specifically the chance that a thief can unlock a PIN code by trying four different attempts. The PIN is a four-digit code, and each digit can be from 0 to 9, meaning repetition is allowed. So, the thief is trying four different PINs, and I need to find the probability that at least one of those four attempts is correct.\n\nHmm, okay. So, it's not about calculating the probability of a single PIN being correct, but the probability that one of four tries is correct. That makes sense. So, maybe I should first figure out the total number of possible PINs and then figure out the probability of success in four attempts.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of possible four-digit PINs. Since each digit can be from 0 to 9 and repetition is allowed, that means for each of the four positions in the PIN, there are 10 possible choices. So, the total number of possible PINs is 10 multiplied by itself four times, right? That would be 10^4.\n\nCalculating that, 10^4 is 10,000. So, there are 10,000 possible four-digit PINs.\n\nNow, the thief is trying four different PINs. So, the question is, what's the probability that at least one of those four is correct? Hmm. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. The opposite event here would be that none of the four attempts are correct.\n\nSo, the probability of failing all four times would be the probability",

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember how bridge is played. In bridge, each player is dealt 13 cards, and there are four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit has 13 cards as well. So, when a player is dealt 13 cards, it's possible that all of them could be spades, but that's a specific case. I need to find the probability of that happening.\n\nLet me think about probability. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out how many ways the player can be dealt 13 all-spade cards and divide that by the total number of ways the player can be dealt any 13 cards.\n\nOkay, so the total number of possible ways to deal 13 cards from a standard deck is the combination of 52 cards taken 13 at a time. I remember that combinations are used here because the order doesn't matter when dealing cards. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of possible hands is C(52, 13). Let me write that down:\n\nTotal number of possible hands = C(52, 13) = 52! / (13! * (52 - 13)!) = 52! / (13! * 39!)\n\nOkay, that's the denominator for my probability.

We have 25 people total, and we need to divide them into 5 teams, each with 5 people. So, it's like splitting them into 5 equal groups. Now, we have two specific people, let's call them Alice and Bob, and we want to find the probability that both Alice and Bob are on the same team.\n\nAlright, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out how many ways Alice and Bob can be on the same team and then divide that by the total number of ways they can be divided into teams.\n\nLet me start by considering the total number of ways to divide 25 people into 5 teams of 5. Hmm, that's a multinomial coefficient, right? The formula for dividing n objects into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n! divided by (k1! * k2! * ... * km!). In this case, each team is of size 5, so the total number of ways is 25! divided by (5!^5).

The counterfeit coin is lighter than the others. I need to figure out how to identify which one is counterfeit using the least number of weighings. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is a classic problem in logic and problem-solving. It's similar to the classic counterfeit coin puzzles where you have to find the fake one by weighing groups of coins against each other. The key here is to minimize the number of weighings, so I need a systematic approach.\n\nLet me start by considering how much information I can get from each weighing. Each time I weigh coins against each other, there are three possible outcomes: the left side is heavier, the right side is heavier, or both sides are equal. So, each weighing gives me some information that can help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nSince there are 8 coins, and each coin could be the counterfeit one, I need to figure out how to divide them into groups so that each weighing effectively reduces the number of possibilities. If I can split the coins into three groups, each weighing can give me three possible outcomes, which is the most efficient way to maximize the information gained.\n\nLet me try to calculate how many weighings are needed. The formula for the minimum number of weighings required to find one counterfeit among N items is based on the information theory. Each weighing can give me up to log base 3 of N outcomes. So, the number of weighings needed is the smallest integer k such that 3^k is greater than or equal to N.\n\nIn this case, N is 8. Let me compute log base 3 of 8. I know that 3^2 is 9, which is just above 8. So, k is 2. That suggests that 2 weighings should be enough. But wait, I need to make sure that this is",

The question is specifically about the probability that the last ball drawn is red.

So, maybe instead of thinking about who's left at the end, I can think about who's being drawn first or something like that.\n\nWait, actually, I think there's a principle where the probability that a particular ball is last can be related to its \"position\" or something. But I'm not sure. Let me recall. Oh, I think it's something about each position in the permutation of the draws being equally likely. So, if I consider all possible orders of drawing the balls, each order is equally probable.\n\nSo, the total number of possible orders is the number of permutations of 5 balls, which is 5 factorial, which is 120.

You roll all 5 dice, and if you get at least four of the same number, you win a prize. I need to figure out the probability of winning. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with dice, each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. So, when rolling five dice, each die is independent of the others, and each has an equal chance of landing on any of the six numbers. Since each die is independent, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice is 6 multiplied by itself five times, which is 6^5. Let me calculate that:\n\n6^5 = 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 7776.\n\nSo, there are 7,776 possible different outcomes when rolling five dice.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability of getting at least four dice showing the same number. That means I need to figure out how many ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 7,776.\n\nWhen the problem says \"at least four,\" that includes two scenarios: either exactly four dice show the same number, or all five dice show the same number.

For example, all ones, all twos, up to all sixes. So, that's 6 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, onto the more complex part: getting exactly four dice showing the same number. This is",

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the game is simple: they take turns rolling a fair six-sided die. Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on. The first one to roll a 6 wins the game. I need to find the probability that Alice has a higher chance of winning than Bob.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a probability problem involving sequences and maybe some geometric series. Let me try to break it down.\n\nLet's denote the probability that Alice wins as P. Since Alice goes first, she has the first chance to roll a 6. If she rolls a 6 on her first turn, she wins immediately. The probability of that happening is 1/6.\n\nBut if she doesn't roll a 6, which happens with probability 5/6, then Bob gets a chance to roll. Now, Bob then has a 1/6 chance to win by rolling a 6. If Bob also doesn't roll a 6, which is again 5/6, then it's Alice's turn again.\n\nSo, this seems like an infinite geometric series where each \"cycle\" consists of both Alice and Bob not rolling a 6, and then the game continues.

So that means there are 10 pairs, right? So that would be 20 individual socks in total. Now, the question is, if I randomly select 7 socks from this drawer, what is the probability that I get at least one pair? Hmm, okay.\n\nHmm, so probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think this is a combinatorics question. It's about combinations and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me get clear on the numbers. There are 20 socks in total, 10 pairs, each pair a different color. So, each color is unique, and each pair is distinct. When they say \"selecting 7 socks,\" we're selecting without replacement, I assume. So, the total number of possible ways to choose 7 socks from 20 is C(20,7), which is the combination of 20 things taken 7 at a time.\n\nOkay, so the total number of possible combinations is C(20,7). Now, the problem is asking for the probability of selecting at least one pair. Hmm, so that could be one pair, two pairs, up to maybe three pairs if possible. So, instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one pair directly, it might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is the probability of not getting any pairs at all, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the probability of getting at least one pair is equal to 1 minus the probability of getting all single socks, meaning no two socks share the same color.

Hmm, sounds interesting.\n\nLet me try to break it down. There are three people: let's call them Person A, Person B, and Person C.

So, I need to compute the probability of getting exactly two heads in the first four flips and then a head on the fifth flip.\n\nSince each flip is independent, the probability of getting heads on the fifth flip is 0.7, right? And the probability of getting two heads in the first four flips is... hmm, that's a binomial probability. The formula for binomial probability is C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). So, in this case, n is 4, k is 2, p is 0.7, so it should be C(4,2) * (0.7)^2 * (0.3)^(4-2).\n\nLet me calculate that. C(4,2) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6.

I remember it's this classic probability question, but I'm a bit confused about the actual probabilities involved. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the scenario is that there are three doors: let's say Behind Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. One of these doors has a car, and the other two have goats. The game show host, who knows what's behind each door, asks the contestant to choose one door. Then, the host, who is being truthful, opens another door to reveal a goat. After that, the contestant is given the option to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door. The question is, should the contestant switch, and if so, what are the probabilities involved?\n\nHmm, okay, so let's start by understanding the initial choice. When the contestant first chooses a door, there's a 1/3 chance that they picked the car and a 2/3 chance that they picked a goat. That makes sense because there's only one car among three doors.\n\nNow, after the contestant picks a door, the host, who knows where the car is, opens another door that has a goat. So, the host's action is deterministic based on the contestant's initial choice. If the contestant picked the car initially, the host has two doors to choose from to open, both of which have goats. If the contestant didn't pick the car, then the host only has one door to open, which is the one with the car.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if the contestant picked the car, the host has two doors to choose from to reveal a goat. If the contestant picked a goat, then the host has only one door with the car, so he must open that one.

I think this is related to probability and maybe something called the \"coupon collector problem.\" I've heard of that before, but I'm not entirely sure how it applies here.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem. We have a die with six sides, numbered 1 through 6. We're rolling it repeatedly, and we want to find the expected number of rolls until we get a number that we've already rolled before. So, the first roll is always a new number, right? Then, each subsequent roll, there's a chance we'll get a repeat, and we want to find the average number of rolls it takes for that to happen.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. The question is a bit ambiguous. Is it asking for the expected number of rolls until we get a number that's already been rolled, or until we get a specific number again? Hmm. The wording says \"a previously rolled number,\" which is a bit vague. But I think in probability terms, this is usually about the expected number of trials until the first success, where a success is rolling a number that's already been rolled before.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then this is similar to the classic coupon collector problem, where you want to collect all six coupons, and the expected number of trials needed is known. But in this case, we don't need all six; we just need a repeat. Hmm, so maybe it's a bit different.\n\nLet me think. In the coupon collector problem, the expected number of trials to collect all n coupons is n times the nth harmonic number, which is n*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n). But here, we don't need all six,",

Each dog independently finds the prey with a probability of 0.8. What is the probability that the prey is found? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The hunter has two dogs, and each dog has an 80% chance of finding the prey. The question is asking for the probability that the prey is found. So, does that mean at least one of the dogs finds it? I think that's what it's asking. Because if both dogs don't find it, then the prey isn't found. So, I need to calculate the probability that at least one dog finds the prey.\n\nAlright, so I remember that when dealing with probabilities of independent events, we can use the concept of independent events and maybe combine them using addition or multiplication. Since the dogs are independent, the success or failure of one doesn't affect the other.\n\nLet me denote the probability that a dog finds the prey as P(Dog1) = 0.8 and similarly for Dog2, it's also 0.8. The probability that a dog doesn't find the prey would be 1 - P(Dog1) = 0.2, and the same for Dog2.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that at least one dog finds the prey. In probability terms, that would be P(Dog1 finds) + P(Dog2 finds) - P(Dog1 finds and Dog2 finds). Wait, why minus? Oh, right, because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the scenario where both dogs find the prey. So, to avoid double-counting, I subtract the probability that both find it.\n\nSo, using the formula for the probability of at least one event happening, which is P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P",

There are a total of 12 people in the group: 7 men and 5 women. We need to form a committee of 4 people, and we want to find the probability that the committee has more women than men.

What is the probability of rolling each number exactly once?\" Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials, like rolling a die multiple times, we often use combinations and permutations. Since the die has six sides, each roll has six possible outcomes, right? So, when we roll it six times, each time it's independent, and each outcome is equally likely.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of each number being rolled exactly once. That means in six rolls, each number from 1 to 6 appears once. So, I think this is similar to something like the birthday problem, where we calculate the probability that all birthdays are unique in a group. Maybe I can apply the same logic here.\n\nIn the birthday problem, the probability of all birthdays being different is calculated by considering the number of ways to arrange the birthdays and then dividing by the total number of possible birthday combinations. Translating that to the die, it's about the number of ways to get each number exactly once divided by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die six times.\n\nSo, to break it down, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die six times is 6^6, because each roll has six possibilities and they're independent. Let me calculate that: 6 multiplied by itself six times. 6*6 is 36, 36*6 is 216, 216*6 is 1296, 1296*6 is 7776, and 7776*6 is 46656. So, 6^6 is 46,656 total possible outcomes.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to roll each number exactly once.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is an expectation problem, maybe something with probability.\n\nLet me recall, expectation is like the average outcome if we were to perform this experiment many times. So, if I were to try all 7 keys, and on average, how many would I try before finding the right one. Hmm. So, maybe I can model this as a probability problem where each key has an equal chance of being the correct one, right?\n\nSo, suppose there are N keys, and I try them one by one without replacement. The probability that the first key is correct is 1/N. If it's not correct, the probability that the second key is correct is (N-1)/N, and so on. So, the probability that I have to try k keys is the probability that the first k-1 keys were incorrect, and the k-th key is correct.\n\nTherefore, the expected value E would be the sum from k=1 to N of k times the probability that I have to try k keys.

For that, the probability is 1 minus the probability that all birthdays are unique. Maybe I can use a similar approach here, but for three people instead.\n\nSo, let me recall the formula for the probability that all birthdays are unique in a group. For the classic problem with n people, the probability that all have unique birthdays is 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - n + 1)/365. That's because each subsequent person has one fewer birthday to choose from.\n\nBut in this problem, we need the probability that at least three people share a birthday. So, I think I can use the complement rule. The probability of at least three people sharing a birthday is equal to 1 minus the probability that no three people share a birthday. Hmm, but wait, that might not be entirely correct. Let me think.\n\nActually, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists at least one group of three people with the same birthday.

So, this seems like a conditional probability problem. I remember something called Bayes' Theorem which might be useful here. Let me recall what Bayes' Theorem is. It's about updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

What is the probability that at least one of the four aces is in the top 5 cards?\" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving \"at least one,\" it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. So, the complementary event here would be that none of the four aces are in the top 5 cards. If I can find the probability of that, then 1 minus that probability will give me the probability that at least one ace is in the top 5.\n\nAlright, so let's define the events. The deck has 52 cards, and we're looking at the top 5. So, the total number of possible ways to arrange the top 5 cards is the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time. That would be written as C(52,5), which is calculated as 52! / (5! * (52-5)!).\n\nNow, for the complementary event: none of the four aces are in the top 5. So, in this case, all 5 cards in the top 5 must be non-ace cards. There are 48 non-ace cards in the deck (since there are 4 aces). So, the number of ways to choose 5 non-ace cards is C(48,5).\n\nTherefore, the probability that none of the aces are in the top 5 is the number of favorable outcomes (non-ace top 5) divided by the total number of possible top 5 arrangements. So, that probability is C(48,5) / C(52,5).\n\nLet me compute that. But before I do the actual calculations, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the total",

Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup. In a round-robin tournament with 8 players, each player plays 7 matches. That makes sense because each player faces off against every other player once. So, in total, how many matches are there in the tournament? Well, if each of the 8 players plays 7 matches, but each match involves two players, so we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. That gives us (8 \u00d7 7)/2 = 28 matches in total.\n\nNow, each match results in one win and one loss, so there are 28 wins distributed among the 8 players.

So, first, let's figure out the total number of possible distributions of wins, and then the number of distributions where exactly 3 players have 4 wins.\n\nStarting with the total number of possible distributions. Since each match is independent and each results in a win or a loss, the total number of possible outcomes for the tournament is 2^28, because each match has two possible outcomes. But wait, is that correct? Hmm, actually, no. Because in a round-robin tournament, each match is between two specific players, so the outcome of each match isn't entirely independent because the results are dependent on who is playing whom.

If two balls are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that they are of different colors?\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. First, the ratio of red to blue to green is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 red balls, there are 3 blue and 5 green. Hmm, so to figure out the total number of balls, I think I need to add up these parts. So 2 + 3 + 5 is 10. So the total number of balls is 10 parts. \n\nWait, but each part is how many balls? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the actual number of balls, just the ratio. So I guess I can assume that the total number of balls is 10 times some number. Let me denote the number of red balls as 2x, blue as 3x, and green as 5x, where x is some positive integer. So the total number of balls is 2x + 3x + 5x, which is 10x. \n\nBut since we're dealing with probability, the actual number might not matter because it could cancel out. Let me see. The question is asking for the probability that two balls drawn are of different colors. So, I need to calculate the probability that the two balls are not the same color. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1.

The goal is to find the value of p that maximizes the probability of getting a code with exactly 3 ones. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with binary codes or binary strings, the number of possible codes with exactly k ones in n digits is given by the binomial coefficient, which is \"n choose k.\" So in this case, n is 5 and k is 3. Therefore, the number of such codes should be C(5,3). Let me compute that: C(5,3) is 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = (5*4*3!)/(3! * 2!) = (5*4)/2 = 10. So there are 10 possible codes with exactly 3 ones.\n\nNow, each code has a certain probability of occurring. Since each digit is independent, the probability of getting exactly 3 ones is the number of such codes multiplied by the probability of each specific code occurring. Each specific code with 3 ones has a probability of p^3 * (1-p)^2 because there are 3 ones and 2 zeros.

What is the expected number of cards that need to be turned over until the first heart appears?\" Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in probability, expectation often involves calculating the average outcome over many trials. So, in this case, we're dealing with a shuffled deck, and we want to find the average number of cards we need to turn over before we see the first heart. \n\nLet me recall, a standard deck has 52 cards, with 13 hearts, one for each suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, the chance of drawing a heart on any single card is 13/52, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25. Similarly, the probability of not drawing a heart is 3/4 or 0.75.\n\nNow, the problem is about the expected number of trials until the first success, where a success is drawing a heart. This sounds like a geometric distribution problem. In a geometric distribution, the expected number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial. \n\nWait, but hold on. In the standard geometric distribution, we're usually counting the number of trials until the first success, including the successful trial. So, if we're turning over cards until we find a heart, the number of cards we turn over would be the number of trials until the first success, which is indeed a geometric distribution. \n\nSo, in this case, p is 1/4. Therefore, the expected number of trials until the first heart would be 1 / (1/4) = 4. So, is the expected number of cards we need to turn over 4? Hmm, that seems a bit straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait another",

If 65% of the students passed both exams, what is the probability that a student who passed the midterm also passed the final? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a class where 70% of the students passed the midterm exam and 75% passed the final exam. Now, 65% of the students passed both exams. The question is asking for the probability that a student who passed the midterm also passed the final. So, it's like we're focusing on the students who passed the midterm and among them, what's the probability they also passed the final.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. So, in this case, we want the probability that a student passed the final, given that they passed the midterm. That is, P(final | midterm passed). \n\nOkay, so the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B), where A is the event that a student passed the final, and B is the event that a student passed the midterm. So, in this case, A is passing the final, B is passing the midterm. So, we have P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). \n\nGiven in the problem, P(A \u2229 B) is 65%, which is the probability that a student passed both exams.

I need to figure out the probability that if I randomly select 6 bulbs, exactly 2 of them are defective. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I guess I need to find how many ways I can pick 6 bulbs where exactly 2 are defective and 4 are non-defective, and then divide that by the total number of ways to pick any 6 bulbs from the 20.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The total number of ways to choose 6 bulbs out of 20 is a combination problem because the order in which we pick the bulbs doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number, and k is how many we're choosing. So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(20, 6).\n\nCalculating that, C(20, 6) is 20! / (6! * 14!) which is a big number. I can calculate it step by step or maybe I can leave it as C(20, 6) for now since I'll have to use it in both the numerator and denominator eventually.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, I need the number of ways to choose 2 defective bulbs out of 4 and 4 non-defective bulbs out of the remaining 16. So, that should be C(4, 2) * C(16, 4). Let me check that: choosing 2 defective from 4 and 4 good ones from the remaining 16.

The goal is to figure out the probability that player A wins the game. Hmm, okay, so how does this work exactly? Let me try to understand the rules. I think the first player to roll a 6 wins, right? So if A goes first, they roll the die. If they get a 6, they win immediately. If not, then it's B's turn. B rolls; if they get a 6, they win. If not, it goes back to A, and so on until someone rolls a 6.\n\nSo, it's like a turn-based game with a probability element. Since the die is fair, the probability of rolling a 6 on any turn is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 6 is 5/6. I think I can model this as an infinite series where each term represents the probability that A wins on their nth turn. That makes sense because the game can, in theory, go on forever, but the probability diminishes each round.\n\nLet me define the probability that A wins as P. So, on the first turn, A has a 1/6 chance to win immediately. If A doesn't win on the first turn, which happens with probability 5/6, then B gets a chance to roll. B also has a 1/6 chance to win, so the probability that B wins on their first turn is 5/6 (A doesn't win) multiplied by 1/6 (B wins). If both A and B fail, then it's back to A, and the situation resets, so the probability is (5/6)*(5/6)*P, where P is the probability that A wins from that point.\n\nSo, putting that together, the total probability P can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities",

So, the problem is about probability, specifically conditional probability. It mentions a test for a certain disease. The test has a false positive rate of 5% and a false negative rate of 2%. It also says that 3% of the population has the disease. The question is asking for the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease. Hmm, that sounds like a classic conditional probability problem, probably using Bayes' Theorem.\n\nLet me recall Bayes' Theorem. It states that the probability of an event A given that B has occurred is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In mathematical terms, that's P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B). So, in this case, I think A is the event that a person has the disease, and B is the event that they test positive. So, we need to find P(Disease | Positive).\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. First, let's note down the given information:\n\n- False positive rate (P(Positive | No Disease)) = 5%, which is 0.05.\n- False negative rate (P(No Positive | Disease)) = 2%, which is 0.02.\n- P(Disease) = 3%, which is 0.03.\n\nWe need to find P(Disease | Positive).

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with coin flips, each flip is independent, and each has two possible outcomes: heads or tails, each with a probability of 0.5. So, the number of heads Alice gets follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=8 and p=0.5, and similarly for Bob with n=10 and p=0.5.\n\nI need to find the probability that Alice's number of heads is greater than Bob's. Let me denote Alice's number of heads as X and Bob's as Y. So, I need to calculate P(X > Y).\n\nI remember that for two independent binomial variables, the joint probability can be calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities. So, P(X > Y) is the sum over all possible values of Y of P(X > y) * P(Y = y), right? So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nP(X > Y) = \u03a3 [P(X = k) * P(Y = y)] for all k > y.\n\nBut since X and Y are independent, the joint probability P(X = k and Y = y) is P(X = k) * P(Y = y).

The factory has a 0.5% defect rate, and the components are shipped in boxes of 200. The question is asking for the probability that a box contains at least one defective component. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials or items, especially when we're looking for the probability of at least one occurrence, it's often easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. So, in this case, instead of calculating the probability that there's at least one defective component, I can calculate the probability that there are no defective components and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the desired probability.\n\nSo, let me define the problem more formally. Let's say each component has a probability of being defective, which is given as 0.5%. That means the probability of a component being good is 1 - 0.005, which is 0.995. Since the components are shipped in boxes of 200, we can model this as a binomial distribution problem. Each component is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: defective or not defective.\n\nIn the binomial distribution, the probability of having exactly k successes (in this case, non-defective components) in n trials is given by the formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nBut since we're looking for the probability of zero defective components, which is the same as all components being good, k would be 0 in this case.

A goes first, then B, then C, and then back to A, and so on. Each shooter has a probability of hitting their target. A has a 1/3 chance, B has a 2/3 chance, and C has a 1, meaning they always hit. The goal is to figure out the strategy that maximizes the probability that A survives. Hmm, interesting.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. So, it's a turn-based game where each shooter takes a turn to shoot another shooter. Since A goes first, followed by B, then C, and then it cycles back. Each shooter has different probabilities: A is not very accurate with a 1/3 chance, B is better with 2/3, and C is a sure shot with 1. So, obviously, C is the most dangerous because they always hit. So, if C is still alive, they can take out anyone else on their turn.\n\nThe question is, what's the best strategy for A to survive? I think this is a probability problem that might involve game theory, where each shooter is trying to maximize their own survival while minimizing the chances of the others surviving. So, maybe we need to model the possible scenarios and see the best possible strategy.\n\nFirst, let's think about the order of shooting. It goes A, then B, then C, then A, then B, then C, and so on. Each time, the shooter has a chance to hit the target. So, if A shoots and misses, then B gets a chance to shoot. If B misses, then C shoots. If C misses, it goes back to A, and so on.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Does each shooter shoot at the same target every time? Or does the target cycle? The problem",

The large one delivers 45 babies per day, and the small one delivers 15. So total babies per day in the town are 45 + 15, which is 60 babies. Out of these 60, about 50% are boys. So, 50% of 60 is 30.

Hmm, interesting. I remember hearing about this before, maybe in probability or statistics class. I think it involves flipping the coin multiple times and somehow using the results to make a fair outcome.

So, if I have a biased coin with probability p of heads, I need a way to make the outcomes even out to 50-50. Maybe I can flip the coin multiple times and use some kind of stopping rule to get an approximate fair result.\n\nI think the idea is to keep flipping the coin until I get a certain number of heads and tails that are balanced. For example, if I flip it until I get k heads and k tails, then I can stop and decide the result based on some function of k. But I'm not sure what k should be or how to choose it. Maybe it has something to do with expected number of flips?\n\nWait, I think this might be related to something called a \"pivotal\" or \" martingales.\" Or maybe it's about using the concept of \"balance\" in probability. Let me think. If I flip the biased coin, the probability of heads is p and tails is 1-p. The key is to make sure that in the long run, the number of heads and tails are equal.\n\nAnother approach I remember is using the concept of \"equidistribution.\" If I flip the coin enough times, the proportion of heads should approach 0.5 if it's a fair coin.

Let me try to understand it properly.\n\nThe game is described as rolling a fair six-sided die up to three times. After each roll, you can either stop and keep your score or continue rolling. The goal is to maximize the expected value of the final score. Hmm, okay, so it's an optimal stopping problem, right? I remember something about that from probability theory.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the rules correctly. Each time you roll the die, you can choose to stop and take whatever you have, or you can keep rolling. There's no mention of any penalties for continuing, so I assume that rolling again is a purely optional action, and the only risk is that you might get a lower score if you don't stop at a good time.\n\nSo, to model this, maybe I should think recursively. Let me denote E(n) as the expected value of the maximum score you can achieve with n rolls left. In this case, n starts at 3 because you can roll up to three times.\n\nWait, but actually, it's a bit more precise than that. Each time you roll, you have the option to stop or continue, so maybe it's better to think of E(n) as the expected value of the maximum score you can get with n rolls remaining. That makes sense because each time you have n rolls left, you can choose to take the current roll and stop, or take the current roll and continue, which would leave you with n-1 rolls.\n\nBut hold on, actually, you can choose to stop after any roll, regardless of how many you have left.

So, I need to calculate the probability that one player has all 13 hearts.\n\nOkay, so how do I approach this? I think I need to use combinations and probabilities. Let me recall that in probability, the probability of an event is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to deal the deck is the number of ways to distribute 52 distinct cards to 4 players, each receiving 13 cards.

I need to figure out the expected number of bulbs I have to pick before I find the first defective one. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in probability, when we're dealing with expected value, especially in scenarios where we're waiting for the first occurrence of something, it often relates to the concept of geometric distribution. Let me recall: the geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. In this case, each time I pick a bulb, it's like a trial, and a \"success\" would be picking a defective bulb. So, yeah, this seems like a geometric distribution problem.\n\nIn the geometric distribution, the expected value, often denoted as E[X], is given by the formula:\n\nE[X] = 1/p\n\nwhere p is the probability of success on each trial. Here, the probability of picking a defective bulb on any single try is the number of defective bulbs divided by the total number of bulbs, which is 10/100, right? So p = 10/100 = 0.1. Therefore, plugging that into the formula, E[X] should be 1 / 0.1 = 10. So, the expected number of bulbs I need to pick is 10. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nWait a second, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, geometric distribution can be defined in terms of the number of trials until the first success, including the successful trial, or sometimes it's defined as the number of failures before the first success. I need to confirm which definition is being used here.\n\nLet me check the definition. If I recall correctly, in the basic geometric distribution, the expected number of trials until the",

I need to figure out the probability that Alice wins if both play optimally. Hmm, okay, so it's a classic game theory problem.\n\nFirst, let me recall what \"optimal play\" means in this context. It means that both players are playing in a way that maximizes their chance of winning. So, if Alice can force a win regardless of Bob's moves, then she will win. If not, then Bob can prevent her from winning. So, I need to figure out whether the starting position (15 sticks) is a winning position or a losing position.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the concept of Grundy numbers or Nimbers. Each position in the game can be assigned a Grundy number, which helps determine if it's a winning or losing position. A Grundy number of 0 means it's a losing position, and any other number means it's a winning position.\n\nSo, let's define the Grundy number G(n) for a pile of size n. The Grundy number is calculated as the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from n. In this case, from any pile of size n, you can move to n-1, n-2, or n-3. So, G(n) = mex{G(n-1), G(n-2), G(n-3)}.\n\nLet's start calculating the Grundy numbers from n=0 upwards.\n\n- G(0): If there are no sticks left, the game is over, so this is a losing position. Therefore, G(0) = 0.\n- G(1): From 1 stick,",

Each player takes n shots. I need to find the probability that they make the same number of shots. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me think. So, both players are shooting n times, right? Player A has a 70% chance of making each shot, and Player B has an 80% chance. I need the probability that the number of shots they make is equal. That is, I need the probability that both make exactly k shots, for some k, and then sum over all possible k?\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Wait, hold on. The problem says \"the probability that they make the same number of shots.\" So, it's the probability that the total number of shots made by both players is equal. So, the probability that player A makes k shots and player B also makes k shots, for some k, and then we sum over all possible k?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, actually, I think it's the probability that they make the same number of shots each. So, it's the probability that player A makes k shots and player B makes k shots, and then we need to sum over all k. Or is it just the probability that both make the same number of shots, but not necessarily considering all k?\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is just asking for the probability that the number of shots made by both is equal. So, it's the sum over k from 0 to n of the probability that A makes k shots and B makes k shots.\n\nSo, the probability is the sum from k=0 to k=n of [P(A=k) * P(B=k)]. Since the shots are independent, right? Because each shot is independent.\n\nSo, for each k",
