If n is an integer and n squared is odd, then n must be odd. Yeah, because if n were even, then n squared would be even. So, yeah, that makes sense. I think that's straightforward, but let me think through it properly.\n\nOkay, let's consider what it means for a number to be even or odd. An even number is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Then, n squared would be (2k) squared, which is 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even because it's 2 times 2k\u00b2. So, if n is even, then n squared is even.\n\nConversely, if n squared is odd, then n can't be even because if n were even, n squared would have to be even. So, n must be odd. Therefore, if n squared is odd, n has to be odd.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems almost too simple. Maybe I should approach it from another angle. Let me think about the parity of numbers. An even number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, and an odd number has a remainder of 1. So, if n is even, then n mod 2 is 0. Then, n squared would be (2k)^2 = 4k\u00b2, which is also 0 mod 2, so n squared is even.\n\nIf n is odd, then n mod 2 is 1. Then, n squared is (2k + 1)^2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, which is 1 mod 2, so n squared is odd.\n\nTherefore, if n squared is odd, n must be odd because otherwise, n squared would be even.

Hmm, I remember something about this from my math class. It was this proof by contradiction, wasn't it? Let me try to recall how that goes.\n\nFirst off, what does it mean for a number to be irrational? I think it means that it can't be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like a/b where a and b are whole numbers and b isn't zero. So, if sqrt(2) is irrational, that means there's no way to write it as a simple fraction. Got it.\n\nAlright, so how do you prove that? I think the way to do it is to assume the opposite and then show that it leads to a contradiction. So, let's say the opposite of sqrt(2) being irrational is that it's rational. That means sqrt(2) can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers with no common factors, right? And b can't be zero because that wouldn't make sense for a fraction.\n\nSo, let me write that down: sqrt(2) = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b > 0. Okay, cool. Now, if I square both sides of the equation, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. Hmm, that means 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So, a squared is equal to twice b squared. \n\nWait, so if a squared is twice b squared, that means a must be sqrt(2) times b, right? But we started by saying that sqrt(2) is a/b. So, substituting back in, sqrt(2) would be sqrt(2) = a/b, and a is sqrt(2)*b. That seems a bit circular, but maybe I can use this to find a contradiction.\n\nIf a is sqrt(2)*b",

I remember that in set theory, a subset means that every element of one set is also in another set. So, if A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is in B. Similarly, if B is a subset of C, every element in B is in C. So, putting those together, does that mean every element of A is in C? That seems to be what the statement is saying.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. So, let\u2019s denote the sets: A, B, and C. The notation A \u2286 B means that for all elements x, if x is in A, then x is also in B. Similarly, B \u2286 C means that for all elements x, if x is in B, then x is in C. So, we need to show that A \u2286 C, which means for all x, if x is in A, then x is in C.\n\nSo, let me try to formalize this. Suppose x is an arbitrary element of A. Since A is a subset of B, x must be in B. Because A \u2286 B, by definition, every element of A is in B. Now, since B is a subset of C, any element in B is also in C. Therefore, x, being in B, must be in C as well. Therefore, every element x of A is in C, which by definition means A is a subset of C.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward.

Hmm, induction... I remember that involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start with the base case.\n\nAlright, for the base case, I should choose the smallest value of n for which the formula holds true. Since the sequence starts at 1 and each term increases by 3, let's try n=1. Plugging in n=1, the sum should be 1, and the formula gives (3*(1)\u00b2 - 1)/2, which is (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Okay, that matches. So the base case works.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k-2) = (3k\u00b2 - k)/2. Then, I have to show that it also works for k+1, that is, 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k-2) + (3(k+1)-2) equals (3(k+1)\u00b2 - (k+1))/2.\n\nLet me write that out. If the sum up to k is (3k\u00b2 - k)/2, then adding the next term, which is 3(k+1)-2 = 3k + 3 - 2 = 3k +1. So the sum up to k+1 would be (3k\u00b2 -k)/2 + (3k +1).

In mathematical terms, is P(A) \u2229 P(B) equal to P(A \u2229 B)? Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a power set is. The power set of a set, denoted as P(S), is the set of all subsets of S. So, if I have two sets A and B, P(A) is all subsets of A, and P(B) is all subsets of B.

Hmm, I need to figure out what conclusion can be drawn from these two statements.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. In logic, when you have two premises, you can use different rules of inference to derive a conclusion. I remember that one common rule is modus tollens, which is a form of deductive reasoning used to infer that if we have a statement that leads to a conclusion and the conclusion doesn't hold, then the statement itself must be false. So, in logical terms, if we have \"If P, then Q,\" and we know that \"not Q,\" we can conclude \"not P.\"\n\nLet me write this out to visualize it better. The first premise is P \u2192 Q, where P is \"It is raining,\" and Q is \"The streets are wet.\" The second premise is not Q, meaning the streets are not wet.

Now, does that imply that n is divisible by 2?\n\nWait, I remember something about prime factors. If a prime divides a product, it must divide at least one of the factors.

On the other hand, \u2203y\u2200x(P(x,y)) is \"There exists a y such that for all x, P(x,y) holds.\" This means there is a single y that works for all x, so it's like a universal y that relates to every x through P.\n\nI think these two statements are about the existence of y in different scopes. One is for each x individually, and the other is for a single y that works for all x. So, maybe if I can find a situation where one is true and the other is false, that would show they aren't equivalent.\n\nLet me think of an example. Maybe using the domain of natural numbers.

Hmm, no, because P is the product of several primes, so it has at least the primes themselves as factors. So, P is composite.\n\nNow, what if I add 1 to P? So, P + 1. Since P is the product of all the primes, P + 1 is one more than that product. Is P + 1 a prime number? Hmm, I don't know yet. It can't be one of the primes that we initially listed because none of the p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 divide P + 1. Because if, say, p_i divides P + 1, then p_i would divide (P + 1) - P, which is 1. But p_i is greater than 1, so that can't happen. Therefore,",

Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step. So, first, I should probably recall what odd and even integers are. An even integer is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, like 2, 4, 6, and so on. An odd integer, on the other hand, is an integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, like 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nSo, if I take an odd integer, let's call it 'a', that means 'a' can be written as 2k + 1, where k is some integer. Similarly, an even integer 'b' can be written as 2m, where 'm' is also some integer. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of 'a' and 'b', which is a + b. Substituting the expressions I have for 'a' and 'b', that would be (2k + 1) + 2m. Let me write that out: 2k + 1 + 2m. Hmm, can I combine like terms here? Yes, 2k and 2m are both multiplied by 2, so I can factor that out. That would give me 2(k + m) + 1. \n\nWait, so 2(k + m) is clearly an even number because it's 2 times some integer (k + m). And then I'm adding 1 to that. So, adding 1 to an even number gives me an odd number. Therefore, the sum a + b is odd. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe I should test this with some numbers to confirm. Let's take a = 3 (which is odd",

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Fibonacci sequence is defined as F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a set S with n elements has 2^n subsets in total. That's because for each element, you have two choices: either it's in a subset or it's not. So, for n elements, you multiply the number of choices for each element, which is 2 multiplied by itself n times, hence 2^n.\n\nBut the question is about proper subsets. A proper subset is a subset that doesn't include the entire set itself, right? So, if the total number of subsets is 2^n, then the number of proper subsets should be 2^n minus 1. That makes sense because we're just excluding the one subset that's the entire set S itself.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, for example, if S has 1 element, say S = {a}, then the subsets are the empty set and {a}. The proper subsets would just be the empty set, so that's 1 subset, which is 2^1 - 1 = 1. Okay, that checks out.\n\nWhat about a set with two elements, like S = {a, b}. The subsets are: empty set, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. The proper subsets would be the empty set, {a}, and {b}, so that's 3 subsets, which is 2^2 - 1 = 3. That works too.\n\nLet me try with three elements: S = {a, b, c}.

I need to prove that this is a tautology. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a tautology is. If I remember correctly, a tautology in logic is a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its propositional variables. So, no matter what truth values P, Q, and R take, the entire statement should evaluate to true.\n\nThe given statement is a bit complex because it's a conditional statement connected with a conjunction and another implication. Let me rewrite it for clarity: If (P implies Q) and (Q implies R), then (P implies R). So, symbolically, it's (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2192 R). \n\nI think it might help to convert this into its logical equivalences or perhaps use a truth table to verify its truth values. But before jumping into that, maybe I can analyze it using natural deduction or some logical equivalences.\n\nLet me start by considering the left side of the implication: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R). This is like saying \"If P then Q, and if Q then R.\" So, if both of these implications hold, then does it necessarily mean that \"If P then R\"?\n\nWait, that seems almost intuitive. If whenever P is true, Q is true, and whenever Q is true, R is true, then if P is true, R must be true. So, P implies R. So, the conclusion seems to follow.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of modular arithmetic? Yeah, that might be more straightforward.\n\nIn modular arithmetic, if \\( n \\) is divisible by 3, that means \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\). So, \\( n = 3k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then, squaring both sides, \\( n^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2 \\). Since 9 is a multiple of 3, \\( n^2 \\) is also a multiple of 3. Therefore, \\( n^2 \\) is divisible by 3. \n\nWait, is that all? It seems too simple. Maybe I should elaborate more to make it a proper proof.\n\nLet me try another approach using the concept of congruence.

The expression has two main parts: (P \u2192 Q) and (P \u2227 Q). So, it's the conjunction of these two. So, the entire expression is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nWait, actually, I should clarify the order of operations here. In logic, the implication (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to (\u00acP \u2228 Q), right? So, maybe I can rewrite that first. Let me do that. So, (P \u2192 Q) is the same as (\u00acP \u2228 Q). So, substituting that back into the original expression, it becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nNow, I have a conjunction of two parts: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) and (P \u2227 Q). So, I wonder if I can apply any distributive laws here. I recall that the distributive law allows us to distribute one connective over another. Specifically, the distributive law for conjunction over disjunction is as follows: A \u2227 (B \u2228 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me try that. So, applying the distributive law to (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (P \u2227 Q), I can distribute the conjunction over the disjunction. That would give me (\u00acP \u2227 P \u2227 Q) \u2228 (Q \u2227 P \u2227 Q). Wait,",

Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me recall what set operations I know. The union of two sets, B union C, includes all elements that are in B, in C, or in both. The intersection of two sets, like (A minus B) intersection (A minus C), includes only the elements that are in both (A minus B) and (A minus C). So, A minus B would be all elements in A that are not in B, and A minus C would be all elements in A that are not in C. So their intersection would be elements that are in both, meaning elements that are in A but not in B and also in A but not in C. So, that would be elements that are in A but not in B or C.\n\nOn the other hand, A minus (B union C) is all elements in A that are not in B union C. But B union C includes all elements in B or C, so not in B union C would mean elements that are not in B and not in C. So, those are also elements that are in A but not in B and not in C. Wait, that sounds the same as the intersection of (A minus B) and (A minus C).\n\nSo, putting that together, both sides are the set of elements in A that are not in B and not in C.

The question is asking me to prove that this product is always even, no matter what the integers are.\n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by recalling some basic number properties. I remember that even and odd numbers alternate on the number line. So, every other number is even, and the next one is odd. That means if I have an even number, the next one is odd, then the next is even, and so on. So, if I have two consecutive numbers, one has to be even and the other has to be odd, right? Because they can't both be even or both be odd since there's a gap of 1 between them.\n\nLet me write that down. If I take two consecutive integers, n and n+1, then one of them must be even and the other odd. So, either n is even and n+1 is odd, or n is odd and n+1 is even. Hmm, that makes sense because adding 1 to an even number makes it odd, and adding 1 to an odd number makes it even.\n\nSo, if one is even and the other is odd, what happens when you multiply them? Well, I remember that when you multiply an even number by any integer, the result is always even. Because even numbers have 2 as a factor, so multiplying by another number just adds another factor of 2, which keeps",

Then, I have to assume it's true for some arbitrary natural number k and show that it must then be true for k+1. If both steps hold, then by induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. When n=1, the first odd natural number is just 1.

Hmm, I've heard about proofs by contradiction before, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach this specific one. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that to prove a number is irrational, I need to assume the opposite and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, let's start by assuming that the square root of 3 is rational. That means it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, let's say \u221a3 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1. That's the standard way to approach these proofs.\n\nWait, but if \u221a3 is rational, then squaring both sides should give me 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. So, 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. If I rearrange that, it becomes 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So, this suggests that a\u00b2 is equal to 3 times b\u00b2. Since a and b are integers, this implies that a\u00b2 is divisible by 3. If 3 divides a\u00b2, then 3 must divide a, right? Because if a square is divisible by a prime number, the number itself must be divisible by that prime.\n\nSo, if 3 divides a, I can write a as 3k, where k is some integer. Let me substitute that back into the equation. So, a = 3k, which makes a\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2. Plugging that back into 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, we get 3b\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2.

So, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. \n\nLet me start by recalling what prime factorization is. Prime factorization of a number is the process of breaking down a composite number into prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.

So if r is rational, then it can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So let's say r = a/b, where a and b are coprime integers (they have no common factors other than 1). Then, if we square r, we get r\u00b2 = (a/b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. So, if r\u00b2 equals 3, then a\u00b2 / b\u00b2 = 3.

Hmm, okay, I've heard of mathematical induction before. It's a method where you prove a base case and then show that if it works for one case, it works for the next one, right?

Examples are like 1/2, -3, 4, etc. An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. Examples include pi, the square root of 2, and e.\n\nSo, the statement says that if I take a rational number and add it to an irrational number, the result will always be irrational. I need to show that this is always true. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me denote a rational number as r and an irrational number as x. So, r is in Q, the set of rational numbers, and x is in R but not in Q. I need to show that r + x is irrational.\n\nFirst, let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove. That is, let's suppose that r + x is rational. If that's the case, then r + x is in Q. Since r is rational, and the difference of two rational numbers is rational, then x would be equal to (r + x) - r, which would be rational minus rational, hence rational. But that's a contradiction because x is irrational. Therefore, our initial assumption that r + x is rational must be false. Hence, r + x is irrational.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should elaborate more.\n\nLet me write it down more formally. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that r + x is rational. Then, since r is rational, we can write r as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b \u2260 0. Similarly",

An even number is any integer divisible by 2, right? So, even numbers are like 2, 4, 6, and so on, and odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, etc. So, if n is even, then n can be written as 2k for some integer k. If n is odd, it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Maybe I can use this to solve the problem.\n\nThe problem says that if n\u00b2 + 5 is even, then n must be odd. So, I need to show that if n\u00b2 + 5 is even, n has to be odd. Let me think about the parity of n\u00b2. I remember that squaring an even number gives an even number and squaring an odd number gives an odd number. So, if n is even, n\u00b2 is even, and if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. Let me write that down:\n\n- If n is even, then n = 2k, so n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is even.\n- If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1, so n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, which is odd because 4k\u00b2 and 4k are both even, and adding 1 makes it odd.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 is even if n is even and odd if n is odd. Now, the problem states that n\u00b2 + 5 is even. Let me think about what that means. If n\u00b2 is",
