How many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here: A cube is painted red on all its faces, then cut into 27 equal smaller cubes. I need to figure out how many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, the big cube is painted entirely red on all its faces. So, every face\u2014front, back, left, right, top, bottom\u2014is completely red. Now, it's being cut into 27 smaller cubes. Since 27 is 3 cubed, that means the cube is divided into 3 smaller cubes along each dimension\u2014length, width, and height. So, it's like a 3x3x3 cube.\n\nNow, each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 red faces, depending on where they are in the big cube. The question specifically asks for those with exactly 2 red faces. So, I need to count how many of these small cubes have exactly two red faces.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the cube. The small cubes can be categorized based on their position: corner cubes, edge cubes, face cubes, and inner cubes. The corner cubes are the ones at the corners of the big cube, which have 3 red faces. The edge cubes are along the edges but not at the corners, which have 2 red faces. The face cubes are on the faces but not on the edges or corners, which have 1 red face. And then there are the inner cubes, which are completely inside the big cube and have no red faces.\n\nSo, since I need the ones with exactly two red faces, those would be the edge cubes. Now, how many edges are there on a cube? A cube has 12 edges: each of the 12 edges is where two faces meet. But wait, each edge is made up of 3 small cubes, right? Because the big cube",

Hmm, let me try to visualize this step by step. \n\nFirst, let me think about the initial square piece of paper. It's a square, so all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. Now, the first instruction is to fold it in half vertically. When they say vertically, I assume that means along the vertical axis, so the left and right sides are folded towards the center. So, if I imagine a square, folding it in half vertically would make it look like a rectangle that's half as wide but the same height. So, the height remains the same, and the width is halved. \n\nNext, I need to fold it in half horizontally. Wait, so after the first fold, the paper is a rectangle, and now I need to fold it horizontally. Horizontally, so along the horizontal axis, which would bring the top and bottom edges together. So, folding it horizontally would make it a smaller square, right? Because if the original square was, say, 8 by 8 units, after the first fold it's 4 by 8, and then folding it horizontally would make it 4 by 4. So, it's now a smaller square, a quarter of the original size.\n\nNow, the third step is to cut off the corner where all the folds meet. Hmm, so after folding it vertically and horizontally, the paper is a smaller square. The folds meet at the corner, which is the center of the original square. So, cutting off that corner. Wait, but when you make two folds, the corner where they meet is the center of the square, right? So, cutting off that corner would mean removing a triangle from the center? Or is it",

I need to find the maximum possible area of this cross-section. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rectangular prism has three dimensions: length, width, and height. In this case, those are 3, 4, and 5 units. A cross-section is the shape you get when you slice the prism with a plane. The area of this cross-section can vary depending on the angle of the plane. So, the question is asking for the maximum possible area.\n\nI think the cross-section can be a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, or even a hexagon depending on how the plane cuts through the prism. But to get the maximum area, I probably need the plane to intersect the most number of edges, right? Or maybe not necessarily the most edges, but intersect in such a way that the resulting figure has the largest possible area.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximum area cross-section of a rectangular prism is actually the one that's a rectangle itself. Because if you slice it along one of its faces, the area would be the product of two dimensions. But wait, is that the maximum? Let me check.\n\nThe face with dimensions 3\u00d74 would have an area of 12, 3\u00d75 is 15, and 4\u00d75 is 20. So, 20 is the largest among these. But hold on, is there a way to get a cross-section with a larger area by slicing diagonally?\n\nI recall that when you slice a prism with a plane not parallel to the base, the cross-section can be a parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is base times height, but here, the height is not the same as the prism's height. It's actually the distance between the two parallel",

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. There are four cubes arranged in a row. Since they're identical, each cube must have the same dimensions, say with side length 's'. Now, when viewed from the front, the front view is a square. That means that the projection of the cubes from the front must form a square. Similarly, the right view is also a square. The top view is a rectangle where the length is four times the width.\n\nI think it would help to draw a diagram or at least sketch it mentally. Let me consider the arrangement in 3D space. Since there are four cubes in a row, they could be placed either in a straight line or perhaps in some other configuration. But since they're identical and we have four of them, a straight line makes sense.\n\nWait, but if they are in a straight line, the front view would be a square. So, if we look at them from the front, the height and width must be equal. Similarly, the right view is a square, so the height and depth must also be equal. The top view is a rectangle with length four times its width, so when viewed from above, the projection is longer in one direction.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the cubes to better visualize their positions. Let me assume that the cubes are placed along the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. Let me define the coordinate system such that the front view is along the positive y-axis, the right view is along the positive z-axis, and the top view is along",

So, for a cube, each corner is a right angle where three edges meet. If I slice off each corner, I'm essentially truncating the cube.\n\nWait, truncation... That's when you cut off the corners of a polyhedron, turning each vertex into a new face. So, each corner cut off will create a new face where the corner used to be. Since the cube has 8 corners, I would expect 8 new faces, right? But I also have to consider what kind of shape these new faces are.\n\nThe problem says the planes pass through points that divide each edge in a 1:2 ratio. So, each plane is cutting off a corner in such a way that it's closer to one vertex than the other. Since all edges are being cut in the same ratio, the cuts should be symmetrical in some way.\n\nLet me think about the cube. A cube has 6 faces, each a square. If I cut off each corner, each original vertex will become a new face. What shape would that face be? If I'm cutting through points that divide the edges in a 1:2 ratio, the cut is like a plane that intersects each of the three edges meeting at that corner.\n\nSo, each corner",

The cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. Then, a plane cuts the cone parallel to the base at a height of 8 cm from the base. I need to find the radius of the resulting circular cross-section.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. A right circular cone means it's a straight cone, not leaning to one side. The height is 12 cm, so from the base to the tip is 12 cm. The base radius is 5 cm. Now, if a plane cuts the cone parallel to the base, the cross-section should be another circle, smaller than the base because it's higher up the cone.\n\nSince the plane is cutting at 8 cm from the base, that means the distance from the tip of the cone to the plane is 12 - 8 = 4 cm. So, the smaller cone created on top is similar to the original cone. Because the cut is parallel, the two cones (the smaller one and the original) are similar in shape.\n\nI remember that for similar figures, the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions is constant. So, the ratio of the height of the smaller cone to the height of the original cone should be the same as the ratio of their radii.\n\nLet me write that down. Let me denote the radius of the smaller cone as r and its height as h'. The original height is 12 cm, and the smaller cone's height is 4 cm. So, the ratio is h'/12 = r/5.\n\nWait, hold on. Is the smaller cone's height 4 cm? Because the plane is 8 cm from the base, so from the tip, it's 12 - 8 = 4 cm.

The hole has a radius of 2 cm and is centered on a line connecting the centers of opposite faces. Hmm, let me visualize this. The cube has edges of 10 cm, so each face is a square with sides 10 cm. The hole is drilled straight through the cube from one face to the opposite face, right?\n\nFirst, I know that the volume of the original cube is pretty straightforward. Volume of a cube is side length cubed, so that's \\(10^3 = 1000\\) cubic centimeters. Now, I need to figure out the volume of the hole that's been drilled out, and then subtract that from 1000 to get the remaining volume.\n\nBut wait, the hole is a cylinder, isn't it? It's a circular hole, so it's a cylindrical prism. The radius is 2 cm, and since it's drilled through the cube, the height of the cylinder would be the same as the side length of the cube, which is 10 cm. So, the volume of the cylinder should be the area of the base circle times the height. The area of the base is \\(\\pi r^2\\), which is \\(\\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi\\).

What is the volume of the resulting solid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: A square with side length 6 is rotated around one of its diagonals. I need to find the volume of the resulting solid. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you rotate a shape around an axis, it creates a three-dimensional solid, and the volume can sometimes be found using methods like the disk method or the shell method from calculus. But since I'm just starting out, I need to figure out which method applies here.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the square. A square has four sides of equal length, each 6 units. The diagonal of the square is the line connecting two opposite corners. If I rotate the square around this diagonal, what does that look like? It should form some sort of three-dimensional shape. Hmm, maybe a double cone or something like that?\n\nWait, actually, when you rotate a square around its diagonal, it creates a double cone, also known as a bicone or two cones joined at their bases. Each cone has a base radius equal to the distance from the diagonal to the sides of the square, and the height would be half the length of the diagonal. Let me confirm that.\n\nFirst, let me find the length of the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. If each side is 6, then the diagonal d is sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) which is sqrt(36 + 36) = sqrt(72). Simplify that, sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2). So, the diagonal is 6\u221a2 units long.\n\nNow, when we rotate the square around this diagonal, each vertex not on the axis of rotation will trace out a circle. The figure formed is indeed a double cone. Each cone has a height of half the diagonal, which is (6\u221a2)/2 = 3\u221a2. The radius of each cone will be the",

So, (0.5,0,0) is the midpoint of the edge along the x-axis, (0,0.5,0) is the midpoint along the y-axis, and (0,0,0.5) is the midpoint along the z-axis.

So, if we're trying to form a regular tetrahedron, the net must consist of four equilateral triangles arranged in a way that when folded, they form this shape without overlapping.\n\nThe question gives me four options, each describing a different arrangement of four equilateral triangles. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\n**Option A: Four equilateral triangles arranged in a line.**\nHmm, if I have four equilateral triangles in a straight line, each triangle shares one edge with the next one. So, it's like a strip of four triangles connected edge-to-edge. I think this is called a \"straight net.\" When you fold this, you can bring the first and last triangles together to form a tetrahedron. Each triangle becomes a face, and the shared edges become the edges of the tetrahedron. I believe this works because the straight line arrangement allows each triangle to fold up around a common vertex. So, A can form a regular tetrahedron.\n\n**Option B: Four equilateral triangles arranged in a triangle with one triangle attached to each side.**\nThis one is a bit trickier. So, imagine a large triangle, and on each side of this large triangle, there's another smaller triangle attached. So, it's like a bigger triangle with three smaller ones attached to each side.

I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the prism is closer to the center of the prism than to any face. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I know that a rectangular prism has six faces, and each face is a rectangle. The center of the prism would be the point that's equidistant from all the faces. So, if I can find the region within the prism where any point is closer to the center than to any face, then the volume of that region divided by the total volume of the prism will give me the probability.\n\nLet me start by recalling that the total volume of the prism is length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height, which in this case is 2\u00d73\u00d74. So, the total volume is 24 cubic units. That part is straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the region where a point is closer to the center than to any face. To do this, I think I should first find the coordinates of the center. Since the prism is 2 units in length, 3 units in width, and 4 units in height, the center would be at (1, 1.5, 2). Wait, actually, let me check that. If I consider the prism in a 3D coordinate system, with one corner at (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (2,3,4), then the center would be the average of the coordinates of these two corners.

I need to find the volume of the remaining solid. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you cut off a corner of a cube with a plane, you're essentially creating a new face on the cube. Since the problem mentions that the plane creates an equilateral triangle, that tells me that the cut is such that the three edges meeting at that corner are all being cut at the same point, forming an equilateral triangle. That probably means the cut is symmetric with respect to the three edges.\n\nSo, let me break this down. The original cube has an edge length of 10 cm, so each edge is 10 cm. The volume of the original cube is straightforward: \\( V = s^3 = 10^3 = 1000 \\) cubic centimeters. That's easy.\n\nNow, when we cut off the corner, we're removing a smaller polyhedron from the cube. The shape that's cut off is called a corner tetrahedron, right? Or maybe a pyramid? Let me think. Since it's a corner cut, it's like chopping off a corner with a plane, so yes, it's a tetrahedron.\n\nBut it's not just any tetrahedron; the base of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle. So the base is an equilateral triangle, and the three edges from the base to the apex (the point where the corner used to be) must all be equal in length because it's an equilateral triangle. That makes me think that the cut is such that each of the three edges meeting at the corner is being cut at the same distance from the original corner.\n\nLet me denote the distance from the corner to the cutting plane along each edge as \\( x",

Hmm, let me think about what an octahedron is first. I remember it's one of the Platonic solids, right? It has eight triangular faces, twelve edges, and six vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle, so that should help with calculations.\n\nSince it's a regular octahedron, all its faces are congruent, and all its edges are the same length. The problem says the distance from any vertex to the center is 5 units. That distance is the radius of the circumscribed sphere around the octahedron, sometimes called the circumradius. So, if I can find the edge length from the circumradius, I can then find the area of one face and multiply by eight to get the total surface area.\n\nI recall that for a regular octahedron, the formula for the circumradius (R) is related to the edge length (a). I need to figure out what that relationship is. I think it might involve some geometric relationships, maybe using the Pythagorean theorem or something with the height of the octahedron.\n\nWait, actually, I remember that the circumradius of a regular octahedron can be calculated using the formula R = (a * sqrt(2)) / 2.

Then it's cut into 64 smaller cubes. I need to find out how many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you cut a cube into smaller cubes, the number of small cubes depends on how you cut it. Since the original cube is cut into 64 smaller cubes, that means it's a 4x4x4 cube, right? Because 4 times 4 times 4 is 64. So each edge of the original cube is divided into 4 equal parts.\n\nNow, in a cube, the small cubes can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces, depending on their position. The ones in the corners will have 3 faces painted, the ones on the edges (but not corners) will have 2 faces painted, the ones on the faces (but not edges or corners) will have 1 face painted, and the ones inside, not on any face, will have 0 faces painted.\n\nSo, I need to figure out how many small cubes have exactly two faces painted. That means I need to count the number of small cubes that are on the edges but not at the corners. Because the corners have three faces painted, so if I exclude those, the remaining on the edges will have exactly two faces painted.\n\nAlright, so let me recall how many edges a cube has. A cube has 12 edges, right? Each cube has 12 edges: 4 on the top square, 4 on the bottom square, and 4 connecting the top and bottom. Each edge has a certain number of small cubes.

The base radius of both the hemisphere and the cone is 5 cm, and the height of the cone is 12 cm. I need to find the volume of this entire solid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the volume of a cone is given by the formula V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the radius of the cone is 5 cm and the height is 12 cm, I can plug those numbers into the formula.\n\nLet me calculate that: V_cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 * 12. So, 5 squared is 25, times 12 is 300, divided by 3 is 100. So, the volume of the cone is 100\u03c0 cubic centimeters. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, what about the hemisphere? A hemisphere is half of a sphere, right? So, the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, so a hemisphere would be half of that, which is (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Again, the radius is 5 cm, so plugging that in: V_hemisphere = (2/3)\u03c0*(5)\u00b3. Let me compute that. 5 cubed is 125, times 2/3 is 250/3. So, the hemisphere's volume is (250/3)\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nWait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. Yeah, because a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, so half of that is indeed (2/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. So, 2/3 * \u03c0 * 125 is 250/3 \u03c0. Yep, that seems right",

So, the space between them is like a sort of border or frame around the small cube.\n\nI think the key here is to find the volume of the space between the two cubes and then figure out how much water that is.

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out which one among these four has the highest surface area to volume ratio. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the surface area to volume ratio is a measure of how \"spread out\" a shape is. Shapes with a higher ratio have a larger surface area compared to their volume, so they are more \"open\" or \"exposed.\" On the other hand, shapes with a lower ratio are more compact. So, in this case, among a cube, sphere, regular tetrahedron, and regular octahedron, I need to find out which is the most \"spread out.\"\n\nSince all four shapes have the same volume, the one with the highest surface area will have the largest ratio. So, maybe I should calculate the surface area and volume for each and then compute the ratio.\n\nLet me start with the cube. A cube has all sides equal, right? Let's denote the edge length as 'a'. The volume of a cube is \\( V = a^3 \\). The surface area is 6 times the area of one face, so that's \\( 6a^2 \\). So the ratio for the cube is \\( \\frac{6a^2}{a^3} = \\frac{6}{a} \\). \n\nNow, moving on to the sphere.

What is the angle between any lateral face and the base?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a square pyramid. The base is a square with each side being 10 cm, and the height of the pyramid is 12 cm. The question is asking for the angle between any lateral face and the base. Hmm, I think that means the dihedral angle between the lateral face and the base. Let me visualize this pyramid. It's a square-based pyramid, so it has four triangular faces meeting at a single point, the apex, which is 12 cm above the base.\n\nFirst, I should probably draw a diagram to help me understand. Since it's a square base, all sides are equal, and the apex is directly above the center of the square. If I imagine a cross-section through the pyramid along one of the planes that cuts through the apex and the midpoint of one of the base edges, that cross-section should be a triangle. This triangle will have the height of the pyramid, 12 cm, as one side, and half the length of the base edge, which would be 5 cm, since the full base edge is 10 cm.\n\nWait, no, actually, the cross-section through the apex and the midpoint of a base edge would be a triangle with base 5 cm and height 12 cm. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should consider the slant height of the pyramid instead. The slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge.

Both of the cylinder's circular bases touch the sphere. I need to find the radius of the sphere. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this. \n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a cylinder to be inscribed in a sphere. That means the entire cylinder is inside the sphere, and the sphere touches the cylinder exactly at the top and bottom circular bases. So, the cylinder is perfectly snug inside the sphere. That probably means that the center of the sphere is aligned with the center of the cylinder, right? So, the axis of the cylinder goes through the center of the sphere.\n\nLet me sketch this in my mind. Imagine a sphere, and inside it, there's a cylinder standing upright. The cylinder has two circular bases, each with a radius of 3 cm, and the distance between these two bases (the height) is 8 cm. Since the cylinder is touching the sphere at the top and bottom, the sphere must just barely contain the cylinder. So, the sphere's radius is larger than the cylinder's radius, but how much larger?\n\nI think I need to use the Pythagorean theorem here. Let me think about the cross-sectional view of the cylinder and sphere. If I slice the cylinder and sphere along their vertical axis, I get a circle (the cross-section of the sphere) with a rectangle inscribed inside it (the cross-section of the cylinder). The rectangle has a height equal to the height of the cylinder, which is 8 cm, and a width equal to twice the radius of the cylinder, so 6 cm (since the radius is 3 cm). \n\nWait, actually, no.

The question is asking how many unit cubes remain after removing all the cubes that have at least one face on the exterior of the large cube. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the cube. A 4x4x4 cube is like a Rubik's cube but four layers thick in each direction. So, it's not just a 4x4x4 arrangement; it's a cube, meaning all sides are 4 units long. So, each edge has 4 unit cubes, and the entire cube has 4 layers in each of the three dimensions: length, width, and height.\n\nNow, the problem says to remove all unit cubes that have at least one face on the exterior. So, that means we're removing the outer layer of cubes. But wait, is that the case? Or is it that we remove all cubes that have at least one face on the exterior, which might not necessarily just be the very outer layer. Hmm, no, actually, in a cube, the exterior is just the outermost layer. Because each face that's on the outside is part of the exterior, and the unit cubes that make up those exterior faces are the ones with at least one face on the exterior.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to approach this is to figure out how many cubes are on the exterior and subtract that from the total. The total number of unit cubes is 4x4x4, which is 64. So, 64 is the total.\n\nNow, how do I calculate the number of cubes that have at least one face on the exterior? Well, in a cube, the exterior includes all the cubes that are on the surfaces. So, each face of the cube is a 4x4 square, which is 16 cubes. There are 6",

The problem says that there's a line segment connecting the centers of two opposite faces, and another line segment connecting the centers of two other opposite faces. I need to find the shortest distance between these two line segments. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me try to imagine a cube. A cube has six faces, right? Each face is a square with side length 1. The centers of opposite faces are the centers of two squares that are on opposite sides of the cube. So, if I imagine the cube sitting in front of me, the centers of the front and back faces would be on opposite sides, same with the left and right, top and bottom.\n\nThe first line segment connects the centers of two opposite faces. Let's say, for example, the front and back centers. The second line segment connects the centers of another pair of opposite faces, maybe the left and right centers. So, these are both space diagonals of the cube, right? Because a space diagonal goes through the cube from one face center to the opposite face center.\n\nWait, but actually, the line connecting the centers of opposite faces is actually an edge, isn't it? Because the centers are on the same axis. So, if the cube has side length 1, then the distance between the centers of opposite faces would just be 1 unit along that axis. So, for example, if the front face center is at (0.5, 0.5, 1) and the back face center is at (0.5, 0.5, 0), the distance between them is 1 unit along the z-axis. Similarly, the centers of the left and right faces would be at (0, 0.5, 0.5) and (1, 0.5, 0.5), so the distance is 1",

I think it's also called a twelve-faced solid, but yeah, each face is a pentagon. So, the question is about the number of planes of symmetry it has. \n\nFirst off, what exactly is a plane of symmetry? From what I recall, a plane of symmetry is a flat surface that divides a three-dimensional object into two mirror-image halves. So, if you can fold the object along that plane, the two halves would match perfectly. That makes sense. So, for example, a cube has several planes of symmetry: planes that cut through the middle horizontally, vertically, and along the diagonals, right? So, a cube has more than just three planes of symmetry. But in this case, it's a dodecahedron, which is more complex because it's a pentagonal shape.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many different planes of symmetry a regular dodecahedron has. I think this might be related to its rotational symmetries, but maybe not exactly the same. Wait, no, planes of symmetry are different because they include reflections as well as rotations. So, a plane of symmetry can be a reflection symmetry. So, in other words, if I can imagine flipping the dodecahedron over that plane, it should look the same as before.\n\nI remember that the regular dodecahedron is dual to the regular icosahedron.

It says that the bases are equilateral triangles with side length 4 cm, and the rectangular sides are 10 cm long. The question is asking for the angle between any rectangular side and a triangular base. Hmm, okay, let me visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a triangular prism looks like.

It says that the square is folded along one of its diagonals, and after folding, the two triangular halves form a dihedral angle of 60 degrees. The question is asking for the distance between the two corners that were originally opposite each other. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. A square has four sides of equal length, 4 cm each. If I fold it along one of its diagonals, I'm essentially bringing two opposite corners together. The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a square with side length 'a', the diagonal is a\u221a2. So, in this case, the diagonal would be 4\u221a2 cm, which is approximately 5.656 cm. \n\nWhen I fold the square along this diagonal, the two triangles on either side of the diagonal will form a dihedral angle. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, so in this case, the angle between the two triangular faces after folding is 60 degrees. The original square is flat, but after folding, it becomes a three-dimensional shape, kind of like a book that's been opened at a certain angle.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the distance between the two corners that were originally opposite each other. Let me label the square to make this clearer. Let's say the square is ABCD, with points A, B, C, D in order. If I fold along the diagonal AC, then points A and C will meet at the fold.

The base is a regular hexagon with a side length of 5 cm, and the height of the prism is 12 cm. I need to find the total surface area of the prism. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a prism has two congruent bases connected by rectangular faces. Since it's a regular hexagonal prism, both the bases are regular hexagons, and the sides are rectangles. The surface area of a prism is calculated by adding the area of the two bases and the lateral surface area. So, I need to find the area of one base, multiply it by two, and then add the lateral surface area.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down step by step. First, the area of a regular hexagon. I remember the formula for the area of a regular hexagon is something like \\((3\\sqrt{3}/2) \\times \\text{side length}^2\\). Let me verify that. Yeah, I think that's right because a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with area \\((\\sqrt{3}/4) \\times \\text{side length}^2\\), so six times that would be \\((6 \\times \\sqrt{3}/4) \\times \\text{side length}^2\\), which simplifies to \\((3\\sqrt{3}/2) \\times \\text{side length}^2\\). So that's correct.\n\nGiven the side length is 5 cm, so plugging that in, the area of one base is \\((3\\sqrt{3}/2) \\times 5^2\\).

The hole goes through the centers of two opposite faces and has sides parallel to the cube's edges. The area of the hole is 4 cm\u00b2, and I need to find the volume of the remaining solid. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me think about the cube. A cube with side length 6 cm means each edge is 6 cm long. So, all sides are squares, each 6 cm by 6 cm. The volume of the entire cube would be side length cubed, which is 6\u00b3. Let me calculate that: 6*6 is 36, and 36*6 is 216. So, the cube's volume is 216 cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, the problem says a square hole is cut through it. The hole passes through the centers of two opposite faces. So, it's like drilling a square tunnel through the cube from one face to the opposite face. The sides of this square are parallel to the cube's edges, which means the square is oriented the same way as the cube's faces.\n\nThe area of the hole is given as 4 cm\u00b2. Since it's a square, the area is side length squared, so if the area is 4, the side length of the square hole must be the square root of 4. Let me write that down: side length of hole = \u221a4 = 2 cm. So, the square hole is 2 cm by 2 cm.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how this affects the volume.

The options are a truncated cube, a rhombicuboctahedron, a truncated octahedron, and a snub dodecahedron. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these has 32 edges. Let me try to recall what each of these solids looks like and how their edges are formed.\n\nFirst, let's start by thinking about each solid individually. I'll list down the number of edges each one has and see if it matches 32.\n\nStarting with the truncated cube. A cube has 12 edges, right? When you truncate a cube, which means cutting off its corners, each corner is replaced by a new face. The original cube has 8 corners, so truncating each corner adds a new triangular face for each corner. Now, how does this affect the number of edges?\n\nIn a cube, each corner is where three edges meet. When you truncate a corner, you're essentially cutting off that corner, which replaces the original vertex with a new triangular face. Each triangular face is an equilateral triangle, which has three edges. But wait, each of these new edges is shared between two adjacent truncated corners, right? So for each original edge of the cube, which is shared by two corners, truncating both ends will turn each original edge into a new edge. So, the original 12 edges become 12 new edges. Plus, each corner adds three new edges, but each new edge is shared by two corners, so that's 8 corners * 3 edges / 2 = 12 new edges. So in total, the truncated cube has 12 original edges turned into 12 new edges, plus 12 new edges from the corners, totaling 24 edges. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Each sphere has a radius of 2 cm. I need to find the volume of the convex hull of the eight sphere centers. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, if each sphere touches exactly three others, that makes me think of a cube. In a cube, each vertex is connected to three edges, right? So, if I place a sphere at each corner of a cube, each sphere would touch three others. That makes sense. So, the centers of the spheres form a cube.\n\nNow, since each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres must be twice the radius, which is 4 cm. So, the edge length of the cube formed by the centers of the spheres should be 4 cm. Let me write that down:\n\nEdge length of the cube = 2 * radius = 2 * 2 cm = 4 cm.\n\nSo, the cube has sides of 4 cm each. Now, I need to find the volume of the convex hull of these eight sphere centers. The convex hull is like the smallest convex shape that can contain all the points, which in this case, since they form a cube, is just the cube itself. So, the volume of the convex hull is the volume of the cube.\n\nWait, hold on. Is that correct? The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains all the points. In this case, since all eight centers are at the corners of a cube, the convex hull is indeed the cube. So, the volume of the convex hull is just the volume of the cube.\n\nAlright, so to find the volume of the cube, I know that the formula is edge length cubed. So, volume = edge length^3.

It says it has a rectangular base that's 6 cm by 8 cm, and it has four identical triangular faces. The height of the pyramid is 5 cm. I need to find the total surface area of the pyramid.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what I know about pyramids. A pyramid has a base and triangular faces that converge at a common point called the apex. The base is a rectangle here, so it's a rectangular pyramid. Since all the triangular faces are identical, this must be a right rectangular pyramid, meaning the apex is directly above the center of the base.\n\nSo, the base is 6 cm by 8 cm. That means the area of the base is pretty straightforward. I can calculate that first. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so that would be 6 cm multiplied by 8 cm, which is 48 square centimeters. Got that part.\n\nNow, for the triangular faces. Each of the four triangular faces is identical, so they all have the same area. To find the total surface area, I need the area of one of these triangles and then multiply it by four, then add that to the area of the base.\n\nBut wait, hold on.

So, I need to figure out the area of each triangular face and then multiply by four, then add it to the base area.\n\nTo find the area of each triangular face, I need to know the base length of the triangle and the slant height.

That probably means the cubes are connected at a single corner, forming an L with two of the cubes and then the third cube attached somewhere else? Or maybe all three are connected at a single corner? Wait, that might be more complicated. Let me think.\n\nIf all three cubes meet at a single corner, that would make a kind of 3D L-shape. So, imagine the corner where all three cubes come together, each extending in different directions. So, one cube is along the x-axis, another along the y-axis, and the third along the z-axis, each with their edges meeting at the origin. That would form an L-shape in 3D. But wait, in 3D, an L-shape can be a bit tricky because it can extend in three dimensions instead of just two. So, maybe it's like a corner where each cube is attached perpendicularly to the other two, forming a sort of 3D right angle.\n\nBut actually, in 2D, an L-shape is formed by two rectangles connected at a corner, but in 3D, connecting three cubes at a corner would create a sort of 3D L-shape. So, it's a 3D L, not just a 2D one.

Each prism has a side length of 2 cm and a height of 8 cm. Their axes are perpendicular, and they pass through each other's centers. I need to find the volume of their intersection. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular hexagonal prism looks like. It's a three-dimensional shape with two congruent hexagonal bases connected by rectangular faces. Each side of the hexagon is 2 cm, and the height is 8 cm. So, if I imagine one prism, it's like a hexagonal box that's quite tall.\n\nNow, the problem says that the two prisms intersect each other with their axes perpendicular. I think this means that if one prism is standing vertically, the other is standing horizontally, but both pass through each other's centers. So, they cross each other somewhere in the middle. The axes being perpendicular probably means that the line connecting the centers of the two prisms is the intersection line, and at the point where they cross, the axes are perpendicular.\n\nI need to find the volume of their intersection. So, it's like the overlapping region where both prisms occupy the same space. I remember that when two prisms intersect, especially with their axes perpendicular, the intersection can sometimes be a polyhedron whose volume can be calculated by breaking it down into simpler shapes.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use the concept of volumes of intersection for two prisms. Since they are both regular hexagonal prisms, their cross-sectional areas might be similar, but because they are rotated relative to each other, the intersection could be a more complex shape.\n\nI recall that in such cases, the volume of intersection can sometimes be found by considering the product of the areas of the cross-sections and the length over which they intersect.

Now, the problem says the plane passes through two opposite edges. Opposite edges in a cube would be edges that don't intersect and are parallel. So, for example, if I pick an edge on the top face, the opposite edge would be on the bottom face, directly below or above it, but not sharing any common vertices.\n\nWait, actually, in a cube, opposite edges are those that are parallel and not adjacent.

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out which one isn't possible. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a projection of a cube is. A projection is like the shadow that a 3D object casts on a 2D surface when light is shone from a specific direction. So, depending on the angle from which we look at the cube, the shadow can take different shapes. The shape of the shadow depends on the orientation of the cube relative to the light source.\n\nI know that the cube has six faces, all squares, and each face can be either front, back, left, right, top, or bottom.

Hmm, a regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. Can a cube's shadow be a regular hexagon? I think so.

The cone has a base radius of 3 cm and a height of 4 cm. Hmm, let me visualize this. A right circular cone has a circular base and an axis that goes from the center of the base to the apex (the top point) of the cone. The slant height is the distance from the edge of the base to the apex along the surface of the cone.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a right circular cone, the axis, the radius of the base, and the slant height form a right-angled triangle. So, if I imagine slicing the cone vertically through its axis, I get an isosceles triangle. The height of this triangle is 4 cm, the base is 6 cm (since the radius is 3 cm, the diameter is twice that), and the hypotenuse is the slant height, which is what we're interested in. \n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. If the radius is 3 cm, then the base of the triangle would actually be 6 cm, right? Because the radius is half the diameter, so diameter is 2*3=6 cm. So, the sides of the triangle are 4 cm (height), 6 cm (base), and the slant height, which is the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, to find the slant height, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 6 cm. Now, the sphere that passes through all four vertices is called the circumscribed sphere or the circumphere. The radius of this sphere is known as the circumradius.\n\nI think the formula for the circumradius \\( R \\) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length \\( a \\) is something like \\( R = \\frac{a \\sqrt{6}}{4} \\). Let me verify if that's correct. Hmm, I recall that for a regular tetrahedron, the circumradius can be calculated using this formula. But just to be sure, maybe I can derive it myself.\n\nSo, how do we find the circumradius? Well, one way is to consider the coordinates of the tetrahedron's vertices and then find the center of the sphere that passes through them, which is the circumcenter, and then calculate the distance from this center to any vertex, which will be the radius.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's place one vertex at the origin, and position the tetrahedron in such a way that it's symmetric. For a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so the coordinates should be symmetric as well.\n\nI think the coordinates can be chosen as follows (I remember this from some geometry classes). Let me denote the vertices as points in 3D space. The standard coordinates for a regular tetrahedron can be:\n\n- \\( (1, 1, 1) \\)\n- \\( (-1, -1, 1) \\)\n",

I need to figure out what 3D shape is formed. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know a regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. Each internal angle in a regular hexagon is 120 degrees because the formula for internal angles in a regular polygon is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=6 is (4*180)/6 = 120 degrees. So, each angle is 120 degrees.\n\nNow, the problem says the hexagon is folded to form a 3D shape where opposite vertices meet. Hmm, opposite vertices in a hexagon would be three pairs. If I imagine a regular hexagon, each vertex is connected to the one three places away, right? So, if I label the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in order, then A is opposite to D, B opposite to E, and C opposite to F.\n\nWhen it's folded, these opposite vertices meet. So, it's like folding the hexagon along the edges or along some lines such that A coincides with D, B with E, and C with F. That makes me think of a three-dimensional figure where each pair of opposite vertices are brought together.\n\nI recall that when you fold a shape in 3D, especially with opposite vertices meeting, it might form a polyhedron. I'm thinking of common polyhedrons and their nets. For example, a cube has a net which is a square, but a hexagon is different. Wait, a hexagon can be the net of a cube?

It's kind of like a cube that's been cut at each corner to turn each corner into a triangle and each original face into a square but with the corners cut off. Wait, no, actually, when you truncate a cube, each corner is replaced by a new face. Since a cube has 8 corners, truncating each corner would add 8 new triangular faces. But then the original faces of the cube are also modified. Each original face of the cube becomes a smaller square because each corner is cut off, so each edge of the original cube is now a new edge of the cuboctahedron.\n\nLet me confirm that. If you start with a cube, each face is a square. When you truncate each corner, you're essentially cutting off each corner with a plane that intersects the midpoints of the edges. So each original square face will have its corners cut off, turning each square into a smaller square. But wait, actually, when you cut off a corner, the original square's edge is now a new edge, and the corner becomes a new triangular face.

So, in three-dimensional space, four spheres each touching three others would form a tetrahedron.

I need to find the volume of the resulting 3D solid. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit nervous about 3D geometry, but let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. If I rotate it around one of its sides, what does that look like? I think it might form some sort of three-dimensional shape.

I need to find the angle between the third plane and each of the original planes. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two planes intersect, their intersection is a line. So, the first two planes, let's call them Plane A and Plane B, intersect along a line, let's say Line L. The angle between Plane A and Plane B is 45 degrees. Now, the third plane, Plane C, intersects both Plane A and Plane B along parallel lines. Let's denote these lines as Line M (on Plane A) and Line N (on Plane B). Since they're parallel, Line M and Line N must be parallel.\n\nWait, but if Plane C intersects Plane A along Line M and Plane B along Line N, and since M and N are parallel, that should mean something about the relationship between Plane C and the other two planes. I think it's related to the dihedral angle between Plane C and each of Plane A and Plane B. The question is asking for that dihedral angle.\n\nI recall that the dihedral angle between two planes is the angle between them along their line of intersection. So, in this case, the dihedral angle between Plane C and Plane A would be along Line M, and between Plane C and Plane B along Line N. But since M and N are parallel, the dihedral angles might have some relationship because of that.\n\nLet me try to think of this in terms of vectors or maybe using the concept of normals.

I need to find the area of the resulting triangular cross-section. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 4 cm in this case. Now, the problem says that a plane is cutting through the tetrahedron, and this plane is parallel to one of the faces. It also passes through the midpoints of the three edges that meet at the opposite vertex. So, essentially, the plane is slicing through the tetrahedron somewhere in the middle, creating a cross-section which is a triangle.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out the shape and size of this cross-section. Since the plane is parallel to one face, the cross-section should also be a triangle, similar to the faces of the tetrahedron. The question is, how big is this triangle? To find the area, I probably need to figure out the scaling factor between the original face and the cross-section.\n\nLet me think about the properties of similar triangles and how they apply in 3D. When a plane cuts through a tetrahedron parallel to one of its faces, the resulting cross-section is similar to that face. The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. So, if I can find the ratio of the edges or heights, I can square that ratio to get the area.\n\nBut how do I find the ratio?

They are placed in such a way that each sphere touches exactly four others. I need to find the volume of the convex hull of the centers of these six spheres. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, since each sphere touches four others, that probably means they are arranged in some kind of regular polyhedron. I remember that in three-dimensional geometry, regular polyhedrons have all their vertices equivalent, and each vertex is connected to the same number of others. So, what polyhedron has six vertices where each vertex is connected to four others? That sounds like an octahedron. Yeah, a regular octahedron has six vertices, each connected to four edges. So, I think the centers of the spheres form a regular octahedron.\n\nBut wait, the spheres each have a radius of 1 cm, so the distance between any two centers should be twice the radius, right? Since each sphere touches the others, the distance between centers is twice the radius, which is 2 cm. So, the edge length of the octahedron is 2 cm.\n\nNow, I need to find the volume of the convex hull of these centers, which is just the volume of the octahedron. I remember that a regular octahedron can be thought of as two square pyramids glued together at their bases. Each pyramid has a square base, and four triangular faces. So, if I can find the volume of one pyramid and double it, that should give me the volume of the octahedron.\n\nTo find the volume of a pyramid, the formula is (1/3) * base area * height.

I remember it's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3 cm, and the axis is 7 cm away from the center of the circle. I think that means the distance from the center of the circle to the center of the torus is 7 cm. \n\nWait, actually, I should clarify. When they say the axis is 7 cm from the center of the circle, does that mean the major radius is 7 cm? I think the major radius is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the center of the torus. So yeah, R, the major radius, is 7 cm. And the minor radius, which is the radius of the generating circle, is 3 cm. \n\nNow, to find the volume of a torus, I recall there's a formula involving \u03c0 and some powers. I think it's something like 2\u03c0\u00b2R\u00b2r\u00b2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. Let me check that. Yeah, I think that's right. So plugging in the numbers, R is 7 and r is 3. So the volume should be 2 multiplied by \u03c0 squared multiplied by 7 squared multiplied by 3 squared. \n\nLet me write that down step by step. First, calculate R squared: 7 squared is 49. Then r squared is 3 squared, which is 9. Multiply those together: 49 times 9. Hmm, 49 times 9...

So, I need to calculate both the area of the base and the area of all the triangular faces.\n\nStarting with the base, it's a regular hexagon with side length 4 cm. I know that the formula for the area of a regular hexagon is \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\text{side length}^2\\). Let me plug in the side length:\n\nBase area = \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 4^2\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(4^2\\) is 16, so it becomes \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 16\\).

Hmm, interesting. I think I need to figure out how many unit cubes are visible from one corner view, right? Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you look at a cube, you can see three faces at once from a corner viewpoint. So, if it's a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube, each face has 25 unit cubes. But wait, if I just add up three faces, that would be 25\u00d73 = 75. But that can't be right because some cubes are along the edges and corners where the faces meet, so they would be counted multiple times. Hmm, so I need to adjust for that overcounting.\n\nI remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle. So, maybe I should subtract the overlaps. The overlaps are the edges where two faces meet. Each edge has 5 cubes, but since the corner cube is counted three times, maybe I need to subtract the overlaps properly. But hold on, in inclusion-exclusion, for three sets, it's |A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nSo, applying that here, the total number of visible cubes from the corner would be the sum of the three faces minus the overlaps (the edges) plus the corner cube that was subtracted too many times.

So, the adjacent vertices connected to the origin would be at (6,0,0), (0,6,0), and (0,0,6). The face opposite to the origin would be the one farthest from the origin, right? That face is the one that doesn't share any of those edges connected to the origin.\n\nSo, if I imagine the cube, the origin is at one corner, and the opposite face is the one that's diagonally across the cube. So, the plane I'm looking for is the one that contains this opposite face.\n\nTo find the equation of a plane, I need to know three points that lie on the plane. Since the plane contains the opposite face, those three points would be the three vertices of that face. Let me figure out what those points are.\n\nEach edge of the cube is 6 cm, so the opposite face would be 6 cm away from the origin along each axis. So, the three adjacent vertices to the origin are (6,0,0), (0,6,0), and (0,0,6).

It says it has an equilateral triangular base with a side length of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. I need to find the total length of all the edges of the prism. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a triangular prism is. A triangular prism is a three-dimensional shape with two congruent triangular bases connected by three rectangular faces. So, it has two triangular ends and three rectangles going around the sides. The bases are both equilateral triangles with side length 4 cm, and the height of the prism, which I think is the distance between the two triangular bases, is 10 cm.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total length of all the edges. So, I need to figure out how many edges there are and what their lengths are, then add them all up.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the edges. Each triangular base has three edges, right? So, there are two bases, each with three edges. That makes 2 times 3, which is 6 edges from the bases. But wait, actually, in a prism, the bases are connected by more edges. Let me visualize it: each vertex of the top triangle is connected to the corresponding vertex of the bottom triangle. So, that's three more edges connecting the two bases. So, in total, how many edges does a prism have?\n\nLet me count: each triangular base has three edges, so that's 3 + 3 = 6. Then, the three rectangles connecting the sides each have four edges, but actually, those edges are the ones connecting the bases, which are the lateral edges. So, for each of those rectangles, two of their edges are part of the bases, which I've already counted, and the other two are the lateral edges. Wait, no, actually, no. Each rectangle is formed by",

And when we take the larger cube apart, we want to find out how many of the small cubes have exactly three blue faces.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the small cubes are arranged.

The axis of the hole passes through the center of the sphere, and the hole itself has a radius of 3 cm. I need to find the surface area of the remaining solid, including the inner surface of the hole. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. A sphere has a surface area, which is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. So, for a sphere with radius 5 cm, the surface area is 4\u03c0*(5)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2. But now, a hole is cut through it, which means we're removing some part of the sphere. However, when we cut out the hole, we also create a new surface inside the sphere\u2014the inner surface of the hole. So, the total surface area of the remaining solid will be the original surface area minus the area removed from the outside, plus the inner surface area of the hole.\n\nWait, is that right?

So, the total surface area would be the original surface area minus the area of the circular part that was removed, plus the lateral surface area of the cylindrical hole. Hmm, okay, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The original surface area is 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2. The area removed from the outside is a circle with radius 3 cm, so the area is \u03c0*(3)\u00b2 = 9\u03c0 cm\u00b2. So, subtracting that from the original surface area gives 100\u03c0 - 9\u03c0 = 91\u03c0 cm\u00b2. But now, we have to add the lateral surface area of the cylindrical hole.

Let me visualize this: if I extend the lateral side of the frustum, it would form the lateral side of the original cone before the top was cut off. \n\nSo, the slant height is 13 cm, and the difference in the radii is r1 - r2, which is 8 - 3 = 5 cm. Therefore, if I consider the right triangle formed by the slant height, the height of the frustum, and the difference in radii, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\( l^2 = h^2 + (r1 - r2)^2 \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\( 13^2 = h^2 + (8 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nCalculating",

The question is asking which number is opposite to the face labeled 3. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know a cube has six faces, right? And each face is a square. Now, in a cube, opposite faces are those that are not adjacent to each other; they don't share an edge or a corner. So, each face has one opposite face. The problem says that the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7. That means if one face is labeled, say, 1, the face opposite to it must be 6 because 1 + 6 = 7. Similarly, 2 must be opposite to 5, and 3 must be opposite to 4 because 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, if the opposite faces sum to 7, that means each pair of opposite faces adds up to 7. So, we can pair the numbers as follows: (1,6), (2,5), and (3,4). Each of these pairs is opposite each other on the cube.\n\nNow, the question specifically asks about the face opposite to the one labeled 3. Since 3 is in the pair (3,4), that means the opposite face must be 4. So, 4 is opposite to 3.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me visualize the cube in my mind. Imagine holding a cube in your hand.

If I have square ABCD, with A at the origin (0,0), B at (2,0), C at (2,2), and D at (0,2). Then the diagonal AC goes from (0,0) to (2,2). The slope of this diagonal is (2-0)/(2-0) = 1, so it's a 45-degree angle from the x-axis. Therefore, the axis we're talking about is a line through A (0,0) that's perpendicular to AC.

What is the height of the pyramid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this geometry problem here: A pyramid has a square base with a side length of 6 cm. Each lateral edge of the pyramid has a length of 10 cm. I need to find the height of the pyramid. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the pyramid. It's a square-based pyramid, so the base is a square with each side 6 cm. The lateral edges are the edges from the base to the apex, right? So each of those edges is 10 cm long. So, if I imagine the pyramid, it has a square base, and from each corner of the square, there's a line going up to the top point, which is the apex, and each of those lines is 10 cm.\n\nI need to find the height of the pyramid. Hmm, the height is the perpendicular distance from the apex straight down to the base, right? So, if I can find that, I can figure out the height. I remember that in a square pyramid, the apex is directly above the center of the base, so the height, the center of the base, and the midpoint of one of the base edges form a right triangle.\n\nWait, actually, no, not the midpoint of a base edge, but the center of the base. So, the center of the base is where the height meets the base. So, if I can find the distance from the center of the base to one of the corners, maybe that can help me figure out the height.\n\nLet me sketch this out in my mind. The base is a square, so the distance from the center of the base to any corner is half the length of the diagonal of the square base. Since the side length is 6 cm, the diagonal of the base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonal of a square is side length times square root of 2, so that's 6",

It's cut by a plane that passes through a diameter of the top base and is tangent to the bottom base. I need to find the volume of the larger of the two resulting pieces. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I know that a cylinder has two circular bases connected by a curved surface. The radius is 5 cm, so each base has a diameter of 10 cm. The height is 12 cm, which is the distance between the two bases. Now, the cylinder is being cut by a plane. The plane passes through a diameter of the top base, so that means it's cutting through the top circle, passing through two opposite points on the circumference. Additionally, the plane is tangent to the bottom base. Tangent means it just touches the bottom base at one point.\n\nSo, if I imagine the cylinder standing upright, the plane is slicing through the top from one side to the opposite side, but not through the center but through the edge. Wait, no, actually, it's passing through a diameter, so it's passing through two opposite points on the top. So, if the cylinder is standing vertically, the plane is cutting horizontally through the top from one end to the other, but not along the height. Instead, it's slanting because it's tangent to the bottom base.\n\nHmm, maybe I should draw a diagram. Since I can't draw, I'll try to visualize it in my mind. The cylinder is like a can. The plane is cutting through the top, going through the diameter, so it's a straight line on the top, but then it's also tangent to the bottom.

I need to find the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. \n\nFirst, if each sphere touches three others, it must mean that each sphere is connected to three others in some kind of structure. I remember that in three-dimensional space, four points where each point is connected to three others form a tetrahedron. So, maybe the centers of the spheres form a tetrahedron? That makes sense because a tetrahedron is the simplest three-dimensional shape where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. So, if each sphere touches every other sphere, the distance between their centers should be equal, right?\n\nWait, but hold on. If each sphere has a radius of 3 cm, then the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres should be twice the radius, which would be 6 cm. But wait, is that the case? Because if each sphere touches three others, does that mean it's forming a regular tetrahedron with edge length equal to twice the radius?\n\nLet me think again. In a regular tetrahedron, every edge is the same length. So, if each sphere touches three others, the centers must form a regular tetrahedron where each edge is the distance between two centers. Since each sphere has a radius of 3 cm, the distance between centers should be twice the radius, so 6 cm. That seems straightforward, but I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not a regular tetrahedron? Hmm, but in three-dimensional space, if each sphere touches three others, the centers must all be equidistant from each other. Otherwise, the distances would vary, and some spheres would touch more than others. So, yeah, it must form a regular",

A cube has all edges equal, and each face is a square. Since one vertex is at the origin, which is (0,0,0) in 3D coordinates, the cube will extend along the positive x, y, and z axes.

It's positioned with one vertex at the origin, and the edges are along the positive x, y, and z axes. So, that means the cube goes from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in all three dimensions. Now, the cube is being sliced by the plane x + y + z = 2. I need to find the area of the cross-section created by this slice.\n\nHmm, cross-sections of cubes can be tricky because the shape of the intersection depends on how the plane cuts through the cube. Since the plane is x + y + z = 2, I should probably figure out where this plane intersects the cube's edges. Once I know the points where the plane cuts the edges, I can figure out the shape of the cross-section and then calculate its area.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cube. It's a unit cube, so all sides are 1 unit long. The plane x + y + z = 2 is a triangular plane because it's a linear equation in three variables. But wait, is it really a triangle? Actually, in three dimensions, the intersection of a plane with a cube can result in different shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, or hexagons, depending on how the plane is oriented.

Let me first try to visualize it. The base is an equilateral triangle with side length 8 cm. That part is clear. Now, each of the other three faces is an isosceles triangle with the unequal side being one of the sides of the base triangle. Each of these equal sides has a length of 10 cm. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, let me break this down. The base is an equilateral triangle, so all sides are 8 cm. The three triangular faces are isosceles, and each has two sides of 10 cm. Since the unequal side is one of the base sides, each of these side faces must have two sides of 10 cm and a base side of 8 cm. So, each of these three side faces is an isosceles triangle with sides 10, 10, and 8.\n\nWait, so if I imagine the pyramid, the base is an equilateral triangle, and each of the three edges from the base to the apex is 10 cm.

So, the pyramid has a base with side length 8 cm, and three lateral edges (the edges from the base to the apex) each 10 cm.\n\nTo find the volume of the pyramid, I remember the formula: Volume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height. So, I need to find the area of the base and the height of the pyramid.\n\nFirst, let's compute the area of the base. The base is an equilateral triangle with side length 8 cm. The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * side\u00b2. So, plugging in 8 cm:\n\nBase Area = (\u221a3/4) * 8\u00b2 = (\u221a3/4) * 64",

How many faces does the resulting solid have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a cube with edge length 4 cm. The question says that the cube's corners are cut off by planes passing through points that divide each edge in a 1:3 ratio, starting from each vertex. I need to figure out how many faces the resulting solid has. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cube. A cube has 12 edges, right? Each edge is 4 cm long. If we're cutting off the corners, that usually means we're performing a truncation on the cube. Truncation typically means cutting off a corner, turning a vertex into a new face. Depending on how much you truncate, the shape can change, but in this case, the cut is made by a plane passing through points that divide each edge in a 1:3 ratio starting from each vertex.\n\nSo, each edge is 4 cm, and the cut is made 1/4 of the way from each vertex. That means on each edge, the point where the plane cuts is 1 cm from the vertex, right? Because 1:3 ratio implies that the segment from the vertex to the cut is 1 part, and the remaining part is 3 parts, so total 4 cm. So, the cut is 1 cm from each vertex along each edge.\n\nNow, when you cut off a corner of a cube, you're replacing the original vertex with a new face. The shape of this face depends on the angle at which you cut. Since the cut is made at the same proportional distance from each vertex along each edge, this should result in a regular polygon as the new face. In this case, since a cube's vertex is where three edges meet, cutting each edge at the same proportional distance should result in a triangular face, right? So, each original vertex is replaced by an equilateral triangle.\n\nBut wait, actually, no.",

This axis passes through two opposite vertices. I need to find the volume of the resulting solid. Hmm, let me visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch a square in my mind. Let's say the square is ABCD, with vertices labeled clockwise: A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, the axis we're talking about passes through two opposite vertices. Since it's a square, the opposite vertices are either A and C or B and D. Let's assume it's passing through A and C.\n\nSo, the axis is the line AC, which is a diagonal of the square. Now, when we rotate the square about this diagonal, what does the resulting solid look like? I think it might form some kind of three-dimensional shape. Maybe a double cone or something else?\n\nWait, actually, when you rotate a shape around a diagonal, it can create a double cone or a bicone. But in this case, since the square has four sides, maybe it's more complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's creating a shape that's like two cones attached at their bases? Or maybe a kind of spindle shape?\n\nLet me try to break it down. If I imagine the square rotating around the diagonal AC, each vertex not on the axis (which are B and D) will trace out a circular path. So, points B and D will move in circles around the axis AC.\n\nSince the square has side length 2, the diagonal AC can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonal of a square is side length times sqrt(2), so AC is 2*sqrt(2) units long.\n\nNow, let me consider the distance from points B and",
