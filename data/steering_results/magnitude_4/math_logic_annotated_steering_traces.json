Let me try to wrap my head around this. I remember something about odd and even numbers from my basic math classes, so maybe I can use that knowledge to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an even and an odd number is. An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, right? So numbers like 2, 4, 6, and so on. An odd number, on the other hand, is an integer that when divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1. So numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc. Got it.\n\nNow, the problem says that if n squared is odd, then n itself must be odd. So, n\u00b2 is odd. Let me think about squares of numbers. If I take an even number and square it, what happens? Let's see... 2 squared is 4, which is even. 4 squared is 16, still even. 6 squared is 36, also even. Hmm, so it seems like squaring an even number always gives an even result.\n\nWait, so if n squared is odd, then n must not be even, which would mean n is odd. That makes sense from the examples I just did, but I need to prove it more formally.\n\nLet me try to represent n in terms of its parity, whether it's even or odd. If n is even, that means n can be written as 2k for some integer k. So, n = 2k. Then, n squared would be (2k)\u00b2, which is 4k\u00b2. Now, 4k\u00b2 is clearly divisible by 2, so n\u00b2 is even.

Hmm, okay. I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which means the original assumption must be false. So, if I can show that assuming sqrt(2) is rational leads to a contradiction, then sqrt(2) must be irrational. Got it.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a number to be rational. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if I assume that sqrt(2) is rational, then it can be written as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (because if they had common factors, I can simplify the fraction).\n\nSo, let's set up the assumption: sqrt(2) = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b \u2260 0. Since 2 is a positive number, I can also assume that a and b are positive integers. Also, to avoid having any common factors, I can assume that a and b are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. This is important because if they had a common factor, I could simplify the fraction, and sqrt(2) would then be equal to a simpler fraction, which would contradict the idea that it's in its simplest form.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation sqrt(2) = a/b, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. Then, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2 gives me 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. This implies that a\u00b2 is equal to 2b\u00b2. So, a squared is twice another integer squared, which suggests that a must be some multiple of sqrt",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in set theory, the subset relation is transitive. That is, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A should be a subset of C. But wait, is that always true? I think so, but maybe I should double-check the definitions to be sure.\n\nAlright, so let's recall what a subset is. A set A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B. Similarly, B is a subset of C if every element of B is also an element of C. So, if A is a subset of B, then for every x in A, x is in B. And since B is a subset of C, every x in B is in C. So, putting that together, for any x in A, x must also be in C. Therefore, A is a subset of C.\n\nWait, is there a more formal way to write this? Maybe using logical implications. So, if A \u2286 B, then for all x, x \u2208 A \u21d2 x \u2208 B. And B \u2286 C means for all x, x \u2208 B \u21d2 x \u2208 C. So, if I take an arbitrary element x from A, then x is in A, which implies x is in B because A is a subset of B. Then, since B is a subset of C, x must also be in C. Therefore, every element of A is in C, so A is a subset of C. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I've heard this called the transitive property of subsets.

So, P(A) is all subsets of A, and P(B) is all subsets of B.

Hmm, okay, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works.

Hmm, I remember that Euclid's proof is the classic example for this. But let me try to work it out step by step, just to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.\n\nNow, the idea behind Euclid's proof is to assume the opposite of what we want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, if we assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers, let's say there are primes p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, ..., p\u2099. Then, we can construct a number that has all these primes as factors. \n\nWait, how do we construct such a number? Oh, right, by multiplying all these primes together and then adding 1.

Is that right? I think so. So maybe I can use some kind of transitive property here.\n\nBut wait, how exactly does that work in formal proofs? I guess I need to use some rules of inference. Let me recall. There's the hypothetical syllogism, which is about the transitivity of implication.

That seems exactly like what we need here. So, if I can apply this rule, then the proof should follow.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me try to write it out step by step. Maybe I should start by assuming that P(x) is true for some arbitrary x. So, let's say P(x) is true. Then, according to the first premise, \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 Q(x)), that would mean Q(x) must also be true. So, Q(x) is true.\n\nNow, since Q(x) is true, and the second premise is \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 R(x)), that would mean R(x) must also be true. Therefore, if P(x) is true, R(x) has to be true.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what odd and even integers are. \n\nAn even integer is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer. So, if I have an even integer, it can be expressed as 2k, where k is some integer. Similarly, an odd integer can be written as 2k + 1, right? So, let me denote the even integer as 2k and the odd integer as 2m + 1, where k and m are integers.\n\nNow, I need to add them together. Let's call the even integer a and the odd integer b. So, a = 2k and b = 2m + 1. Then, the sum a + b would be 2k + (2m + 1). Let me compute that:\n\na + b = 2k + 2m + 1.\n\nHmm, I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(k + m) + 1.

First, let me recall what rational and irrational numbers are. \n\nA rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator isn't zero.

So, a = p/q.\n\nNow, if I substitute a into the equation ab = c/d, I get (p/q) * b = c/d. If I solve for b, I can multiply both sides by q/d: b = (c/d) * (q/p). But wait, (",

Hmm, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. I need to show the base case is true and then assume it's true for some arbitrary n, and then prove it for n+1.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. When n=1, the left side is F\u2081, which is 1. The right side is F\u2081\u208a\u2082, which is F\u2083. Wait, what is F\u2083? Since F\u2081=1, F\u2082=1, so F\u2083=F\u2082 + F\u2081 = 1+1=2. So F\u2083 is 2. Then the right side is 2 - 1 = 1. So, 1 equals 1. That works. So base case holds.\n\nNow, let's assume that the formula holds for n = k, meaning that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F\u2096 = F\u2096\u208a\u2082 - 1.

If I have two numbers, a and b, then one of them is the maximum, and the other is the minimum. So, depending on whether a is bigger than b or vice versa, I can split this into cases.\n\nCase 1: Suppose a is greater than or equal to b.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Well-Ordering Principle is. If I remember correctly, it's also known as the Well-Ordering Axiom or the Law of Well-Ordering. It states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. So, for any set S of positive integers, there exists a smallest number in S. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is about expressing every positive integer as a product of primes. That sounds like it's related to prime factorization, right? So, every number can be broken down into prime factors. But I need to make sure I'm not assuming what I'm trying to prove. Let me think.\n\nMaybe I can use induction. Induction is often used in proofs involving integers. Let me consider the base case first. The base case would be n = 1. Is 1 a prime? Wait, no, 1 is not considered a prime number. Hmm, so how do we express 1 as a product of primes? Well, 1 can be expressed as the product of zero primes. That's kind of a trivial case. So, maybe I can say that 1 is the empty product.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the direction I need to go. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the set S_n as the set of positive integers that can be expressed as a product of primes less than or equal to n.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start with the base case.\n\nFirst, let me check for n = 1. If n is 1, then n\u00b3 - n is 1 - 1, which is 0. Zero divided by 6 is 0, which is an integer, so 6 divides 0. That works.

Similarly, the disjunction \u2228 means \"or,\" so \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ is true if at least one of \u00acP or \u00acQ is true, which is the same as saying it's false only when both P and Q are true.\n\nWait, that actually sounds similar to the negation of P \u2227 Q.

Therefore, I did not go to the mall. I need to figure out if this reasoning is valid using rules of inference.

In logical terms, it's like saying If P, then Q. So, P is \"I go to the mall,\" and Q is \"I buy new shoes.\" So, P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe second statement is \"I did not buy new shoes.\" That's the negation of Q, so not Q.

The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is not Q \u2192 not P, and they are logically equivalent. That means if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. So, if I didn't buy new shoes (not Q), then I didn't go to the mall (not P). \n\nWait, so the argument is essentially using the contrapositive.

So, maybe I can show that in any two consecutive integers, one of them must be even.\n\nLet me think about the parity of numbers. Parity refers to whether a number is even or odd, right? So, every integer is either even or odd. If I have two consecutive numbers, n and n+1, they can't both be even or both be odd. Because if n is even, adding 1 makes it odd, and if n is odd, adding 1 makes it even. So, one is even, and the other is odd. Therefore, in the product n(n+1), one of the factors is even, so the product is even.\n\nWait, let me test this with some examples to make sure I'm on the right track. Let's take n=2, which is even. Then n+1=3, which is odd. Their product is 6, which is even. Okay, that works. How about n=3? 3 is odd, 4 is even, product is 12, which is even. Hmm, another one: n=5, odd, n+1=6,",

Hmm, induction seems a bit tricky for me, but I'll give it a try. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. I think it involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check if the statement is true for the base case. The base case is usually when n is 1, right?

I remember that proving whether a number is rational or irrational often involves checking if it can be expressed as a fraction of two integers. If it can't, then it's irrational. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that a rational number can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if I can show that \u221a3 cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, then it must be irrational. \n\nI think the standard method for proving irrationality involves assuming the opposite and then reaching a contradiction. That is, let's suppose that \u221a3 is rational. Then, it can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are coprime integers (meaning their greatest common divisor is 1) and b is positive. \n\nSo, let me start by assuming \u221a3 = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b \u2260 0. Then, squaring both sides gives 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. \n\nSo, 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. If I rearrange this, it becomes 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. This equation suggests that 3 divides a\u00b2. But since 3 is a prime number, if it divides a\u00b2, it must divide a itself. Wait, is that right? Yeah, because if a prime divides a product, it must divide at least one of the factors. So, if 3 divides a\u00b2, it must divide a. \n\nTherefore, a is divisible by 3. Let me write that down: a = 3k, where k is some integer.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what transitive and symmetric mean. A relation R on a set A is transitive if whenever (a, b) and (b, c) are in R, then (a, c) is also in R. So, for divisibility, if a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c, then a should be divisible by c. That makes sense because divisibility is kind of a chain. Like, if a is divisible by b, which is divisible by c, then a should be divisible by c. So I think that part is straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's take some numbers. Suppose a = 12, b = 6, and c = 3. So, 12 is divisible by 6 because 12 \u00f7 6 = 2, which is an integer. And 6 is divisible by 3 because 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, also an integer. Now, is 12 divisible by 3? Yes, because 12 \u00f7 3 = 4. So, in this case, the transitivity holds.\n\nWhat if I try another set of numbers? Let's say a = 15, b = 5, and c = 5. So, 15 is divisible by 5, and 5 is divisible by 5. Then, 15 is divisible by 5, which is trivial because any number is divisible by itself. Hmm, that works too.\n\nMaybe a trickier example. Let me take a = 8, b = 4, and c = 2. 8 is divisible by 4, 4 is divisible by 2, and 8 is divisible by 2. Yep,",

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in math, proving something by contradiction means assuming the opposite of what I want to prove and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, if I assume that there is a rational number r where r squared equals 3, then I should see if that leads to something impossible.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rational number is. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if r is rational, then I can write r as a fraction in its simplest form, meaning that the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.\n\nLet me write that down: Let r = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms), and b \u2260 0. Then, according to the equation, r squared would be (a/b) squared, which is a\u00b2 divided by b\u00b2. So, (a/b)\u00b2 = 3. That means a\u00b2 / b\u00b2 = 3.\n\nNow, if I rearrange this equation, I get a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2. So, a squared equals 3 times b squared. Hmm, okay, so that means a\u00b2 is three times b squared. Since a and b are integers, both a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are perfect squares. So, 3 is a prime number, right? So, if a\u00b2 equals 3 times b\u00b2, then 3 divides a\u00b2.

Hmm, interesting. I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about integers and their parity.\n\nFirst, I remember that every integer is either even or odd.

Well, if a is even and a + b is odd, then b must make the sum odd. Since even plus odd is odd, b must be odd. So, in this case, a is even and b is odd.\n\nCase 2: Suppose a is odd. Then, a can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. If a is odd, then what can b be? If a is odd and a + b is odd, then b must be even because odd plus even is odd.

Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each term means. A tautology is a statement that is always true, no matter what truth values its propositional variables take. A contradiction is a statement that is always false. If it's neither, then its truth value depends on the truth values of its components.\n\nSo, the given statement is (P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)) \u2192 Q. Let me rewrite it for clarity: If P is true and P implies Q is true, then Q is true. Hmm, that sounds a bit circular, but let me analyze it using truth tables.\n\nI know that implication (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to (\u00acP \u2228 Q).

Using the distributive law, which states that A \u2227 (B \u2228 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C), so:\n\n(P \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (P \u2227 Q).\n\nWait, P \u2227 \u00acP is a contradiction, right?

Hmm, I remember that rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like a/b where b isn't zero. Irrational numbers can't be expressed as such fractions. I think I've heard that adding a rational and an irrational number always results in an irrational number, but I need to figure out why.\n\nLet me start by assuming the opposite. Maybe that will help me see the contradiction. So, let's say I have a rational number, let's call it r, and an irrational number, let's call it s. I'll assume that their sum, r + s, is actually rational. If that's the case, then maybe I can show that this leads to a contradiction because s would have to be both rational and irrational, which isn't possible.\n\nAlright, so let me write that down. Let r = a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero, and s is irrational. Then, r + s = c/d, where c and d are integers, and d is not zero. So, according to my assumption, s = (c/d) - (a/b). Now, if I subtract two rational numbers, the result should be rational because both c/d and a/b are rational. But wait, s is irrational, right? So that's a contradiction because s can't be both rational and irrational at the same time.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think about specific examples. For instance, take r = 1 (which is rational) and s = \u221a2 (which is irrational). Then, 1 + \u221a2 is irrational.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let me recall some basic number theory concepts. I remember that whether a number is even or odd relates to its parity, right? So, every integer is either even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2, while an odd number is not. \n\nSo, if n is an integer, then n can be either even or odd. Let me denote the two cases separately. Let me assume that n is even first. If n is even, then n can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. That makes sense because multiplying an integer by 2 gives an even number. Now, if I plug this into the expression n\u00b2 + 5, I get (2k)\u00b2 + 5. Calculating that, that's 4k\u00b2 + 5. \n\nWait, is 4k\u00b2 even? Yes, because 4 is even, and any multiple of an even number is even. So, 4k\u00b2 is even, and 5 is odd. Now, adding an even number and an odd number, what do we get? I remember that even plus odd is odd. So, 4k\u00b2 + 5 is even + odd, which is odd. So, if n is even, then n\u00b2 + 5 is odd. \n\nBut the problem says that n\u00b2 + 5 is even. So, if n is even, n\u00b2 + 5 is odd, which contradicts the given condition that n\u00b2 + 5 is even. Therefore, our initial assumption that n is even must be wrong.
