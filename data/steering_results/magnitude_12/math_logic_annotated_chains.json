Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that odd and even numbers have specific definitions, so maybe I can start from there.\n\nFirst, let me recall: an even number is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. On the other hand, an odd number is an integer that can't be divided evenly by 2, which means when you divide it by 2, you get a remainder of 1. So, an odd number can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, the problem says that n squared is odd. So, n\u00b2 is odd. Let me think about what squaring does to even and odd numbers. I remember that when you square an even number, the result is even, and when you square an odd number, the result is odd. Wait, is that always true? Let me test it with some examples.\n\nIf n is even, say n = 2, then n\u00b2 = 4, which is even. If n is odd, say n = 3, then n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. Another example: n = 4, n\u00b2 = 16, even; n = 5, n\u00b2 = 25, odd. So, it seems consistent. So, if n is even, n\u00b2 is even; if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So, the statement seems to hold in these cases.\n\nBut the question is asking me to prove it in general, not just for specific numbers. So, maybe I should approach it more formally. Let's assume that n is an integer and n\u00b2 is odd. I need to show that n must be odd.\n\nLet me use the",

So, if I can show that assuming the square root of 2 is rational leads to a contradiction, then it must be irrational.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rational number is. A rational number can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if sqrt(2) were rational, it would mean that sqrt(2) can be written as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1 (because if they had common factors, you can simplify the fraction).\n\nSo, let me write that down: Let\u2019s assume the opposite of what we want to prove.

Then, sqrt(2) = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b is not zero.\n\nNow, if sqrt(2) = a/b, then squaring both sides should give me 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2.

So, a\u00b2 is an even number because it's 2 times something.\n\nIf a\u00b2 is even, that means a must also be even, right? Because the square of an odd number is odd.

Hmm, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the statement is true for the initial value, usually n = 1. Then, I assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k and try to show it must then be true for k + 1. If both steps hold, the proof is complete.\n\nAlright, starting with the base case.

Hmm, induction seems like the way to go here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's usually done in two steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case. The problem says n is an integer greater than or equal to 5, so let me start by testing n = 5. Let me calculate 2^5 and 5 squared. 2^5 is 32 and 5 squared is 25. So, 32 is indeed greater than 25.

Then, I have to show that 2^(k+1) > (k+1)^2. Hmm, how do I relate 2^(k+1) to 2^k? Well, 2^(k+1) is equal to 2 * 2^k.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, let me recall what the Fibonacci sequence is. It starts with F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones. So, F\u2083 = F\u2082 + F\u2081 = 1 + 1 = 2, F\u2084 = F\u2083 + F\u2082 = 2 + 1 = 3, and so on.\n\nThe identity I need to prove is that the sum from F\u2081 to F\u2099 is equal to F_{n+2} minus 1. So, for example, if n=1, the sum is just F\u2081 = 1, and F_{1+2} - 1 is F\u2083 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, which works. For n=2, the sum is F\u2081 + F\u2082 = 1 + 1 = 2, and F_{2+2} - 1 = F\u2084 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2, which also works. Let me check n=3: sum is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, and F\u2085 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4. Okay, so the base cases hold.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_k = F_{k+2} - 1. Then, I need to show that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_k + F_{k+1} = F_{k+3} - ",

Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that max(a, b) is the larger of the two numbers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller one. So, if a is bigger than b, then max(a, b) is a and min(a, b) is b. If b is bigger than a, then max(a, b) is b and min(a, b) is a. So, in either case, when I add the max and the min, I should get a + b.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me test with some numbers. Suppose a is 5 and b is 3. Then max(5,3) is 5, min(5,3) is 3. Adding them gives 5 + 3 = 8, which is equal to 5 + 3. Okay, that works. What if a and b are equal? Let's say a is 4 and b is 4. Then max(4,4) is 4, min(4,4) is 4. Adding them gives 8, which is the same as 4 + 4. Hmm, that also works. What about negative numbers? Let's take a as -2 and b as 1. Then max(-2,1) is 1, min(-2,1) is -2.

Hmm, I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

So maybe I need to use induction to prove that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of primes.\n\nLet me think about how induction works. We usually prove a base case and then show that if it holds for some integer, it holds for the next one. So, for the base case, let's take the smallest positive integer, which is 1. Can 1 be expressed as a product of primes? Hmm, primes are numbers greater than 1, so the smallest prime is 2.

Hmm, I remember that countable sets are those that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. So, if I can list all the rational numbers in a sequence where each one can be associated with a natural number, then they are countable.\n\nI've heard about Cantor's diagonal argument before, which is used to show that the real numbers are uncountable. Maybe I can use something similar, but in reverse. Instead of showing the uncountability of reals, I need to show that the rationals are countable.\n\nLet me recall how Cantor's diagonal argument works. He lists all the real numbers between 0 and 1 as an infinite decimal expansion. Then, he diagonalizes by changing each digit at a certain diagonal to create a new number that's not in the original list. But since we're dealing with rationals, which are countable, maybe I can do something similar but in a finite way.\n\nWait, the rationals are countable because they can be expressed as fractions. So, perhaps I can enumerate them by their numerators and denominators. For example, for each natural number n, I can have a pair (p_n, q_n), where p_n is the numerator and q_n is the denominator. But that might not directly give a bijection.\n\nAnother approach is to use a specific enumeration. I remember that every rational number can be expressed in its reduced form, where the numerator and denominator are coprime. Maybe I can create a list where I first list all fractions with denominator 1, then denominators 2, then 3, and so on. Within each denominator, I can list the numerators in order.\n\nBut I think a more systematic way is to use a pairing function. A pairing function is a bijection from N x N to N",

So, I should probably start by checking the base case and then assume it's true for some integer k and prove it for k + 1.\n\nFirst, the base case. Let me pick the smallest positive integer, which is 1. So, plugging n = 1 into the expression, I get 1\u00b3 - 1, which is 1 - 1 = 0.

Let me calculate 4! and 2^4. 4! is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 24. And 2^4 is 16. So, 24 > 16, which means the base case holds.

So, if A is a subset of B, I need to show that every subset of A is also a subset of B. \n\nLet me start by recalling some definitions. A subset A is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B. So, if A \u2286 B, then for all x, if x is in A, then x is in B.

So, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.

So, if the original is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and if the contrapositive is true, the original is too.\n\nNext, the converse.

Therefore, I did not go to the mall. I need to figure out if this reasoning is valid using rules of inference. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the statement is in the form of a conditional. The major premise is \"If I go to the mall, I buy new shoes.\" That can be written symbolically as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"I go to the mall\" and Q is \"I buy new shoes.\" The minor premise is \"I did not buy new shoes,\" which is \u00acQ. The conclusion is \"I did not go to the mall,\" which is \u00acP.\n\nSo, the argument is P \u2192 Q, \u00acQ, therefore \u00acP. I remember something about contrapositives and inverses in logic. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and they're logically equivalent. That means if the contrapositive is true, the original implication is also true, and vice versa. So if not buying shoes implies not going to the mall, then the original statement holds.\n\nWait, but does that mean the argument is valid? I think so, because the contrapositive is a valid inference. Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The converse would be Q \u2192 P, which isn't necessarily true. The inverse would be \u00acP \u2192 Q, which isn't the case here. The contrapositive is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly what the argument uses.\n\nSo, the reasoning is using the contrapositive, which is a rule of inference. Therefore, the argument is valid because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication, and using it in a syllogism makes the conclusion valid.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the absorption law, which states that A \u2227 (A \u2228 B) is equivalent to A. Wait, let me think.\n\nIn this case, we have (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 P. Since we're dealing with a conjunction, maybe I can distribute the \u2227 over the \u2228. So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 P would be equivalent to \u00acP \u2227 P \u2228 Q \u2227 P.

The task is to show that when you multiply these two numbers together, the result is always an even number. \n\nOkay, so maybe I can start by defining what consecutive integers are.

Hmm, I remember that in logic, proving equivalence means showing that each statement implies the other. So I need to show that if P implies (Q implies R), then (P and Q) implies R, and vice versa. Let me start by understanding each part.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each implication means. P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R) means that if P is true, then whenever Q is true, R must also be true. On the other hand, (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R means that if both P and Q are true, then R must be true. So, intuitively, these seem related, but I need to formalize this.\n\nI think a good way to approach this is by using truth tables. But wait, before jumping into that, maybe I can use natural deduction or some logical equivalences to transform one side into the other. Let me try both methods and see which one makes more sense.\n\nStarting with the first direction: Assume P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R) and show that (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 R. So, assume (P \u2227 Q) is true. Then, by the definition of implication, if P is true, then Q \u2192 R must be true. But since we have P \u2227 Q, both P and Q are true.

Hmm, okay, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's like a domino effect, right? You prove the base case, then show that if it works for one case, it works for the next, and so on.\n\nFirst, the base case. Let's start with n=1.

If A is any set, no matter what elements it has, adding the empty set shouldn't change it. Yeah, that seems right. For example, if A is {1, 2, 3}, then A \u222a \u2205 is still {1, 2, 3}.

Hmm, let me think about what transitive and symmetric mean first.\n\nTransitive means that if a relation holds for two elements, it should also hold for another element in a specific way. Specifically, for a relation R on a set S, it's transitive if whenever aRb and bRc, then aRc. So, for divisibility, if a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c, then a should be divisible by c. That makes sense because if a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c, then a is a multiple of b, and b is a multiple of c, so a must be a multiple of c. So, I think that works.\n\nSymmetric means that if aRb, then bRa as well. In the case of divisibility, if a is divisible by b, does that mean b is divisible by a? Well, not necessarily.

Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if r is rational, then r can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero.\n\nSo, if r = a/b, then r squared would be (a/b)^2, which is a\u00b2 divided by b\u00b2.

So, 3b\u00b2 is three times a perfect square.\n\nWait, so if a\u00b2 equals 3 times b squared, that would mean that 3 divides a\u00b2. Because 3 times b squared is divisible by 3, so a\u00b2 must also be divisible by 3. If 3 divides a\u00b2, then 3 must divide a. I remember that if a prime number divides a square, then it must divide the number itself. So, 3 divides a. That means we can write a as 3k, where k is some integer.\n\nSo, substituting back in, a = 3k. Then, plugging that into the equation a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2, we get (3k)^2 = 3b\u00b2, which simplifies to 9k\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2. Dividing both sides by 3, we get 3k\u00b2 = b\u00b2.

Hmm, induction is something I remember from my math class, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Let me try to recall how mathematical induction works.\n\nFirst, I think induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you show that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step is where you assume it's true for some arbitrary integer k and then prove it for k+1. If both steps are successful, then the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nAlright, so let me start with the base case. What is the sum of the first 1 positive integer? Well, that's just 1. According to the formula, plugging in n=1 should give 1(1+1)/2, which is 2/2, which is 1. So, 1=1. That checks out. So the base case works. Cool.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. Let me assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I'll assume that the sum of the first k positive integers is k(k+1)/2. So, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Got that.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this is true for k, then it must also be true for k+1. That is, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 positive integers is equal to (k+1)(k+2)/2. So, the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1).\n\nHmm, how can I relate this to the assumption that the sum up to k is k(k",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that odd and even numbers have specific definitions, so maybe I should start by recalling those.\n\nAn even number is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer.

So, n is odd if n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nAlright, so if a and b are two integers, and their sum a + b is odd, I need to show that exactly one of them is odd. That means either a is odd and b is even, or a is even and b is odd. But not both odd or both even.\n\nLet me consider the possible cases.

Well, if both a and b are even, then a = 2k and b = 2m for some integers k and m. Then a + b = 2k + 2m = 2(k + m), which is even. But the sum is supposed to be odd, so that's a contradiction. Similarly, if both a and b are odd, then a = 2k + 1 and b = 2m + 1. Then a + b = 2k + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2(k + m + 1), which",

I remember that negating quantifiers can be a bit tricky, but I think the process involves flipping the order of the quantifiers and adding negations appropriately.\n\nFirst, the original statement is a universal statement because it starts with \u2200x and \u2200y. Inside that, there's an existential quantifier \u2203z. The structure is: for every x and every y, there exists a z such that P(x,y) implies Q(y,z).

Hmm, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works.

Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm just starting to get into these kinds of problems, so I need to take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, let me parse the statement. It says that if n\u00b2 + 5 is even, then n must be odd. So, in logical terms, it's like saying \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"n\u00b2 + 5 is even\" and Q is \"n is odd.\" I need to prove that P implies Q. That means I need to show that whenever n\u00b2 + 5 is even, n has to be odd. If I can show that, then the statement is proven.\n\nAlright, so let me recall some basic number theory. I know that even and odd numbers have specific properties when squared. Let me think. An even number is any integer that can be written as 2k, where k is an integer, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Similarly, an odd number can be written as 2k + 1. Maybe I can use this to explore n\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider two cases: one where n is even and one where n is odd. If I can show that in the case where n is even, n\u00b2 + 5 is not even, then that would prove that if n\u00b2 + 5 is even, n cannot be even, which would mean n must be odd. That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, first case: suppose n is even. Then n = 2k for some integer k. Let's compute n\u00b2. If n = 2k, then n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2. So, n",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use modular arithmetic or some properties of numbers. Let me start by recalling that if a number is divisible by 3, then it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. So, if I can show that n\u00b3 + 2n is congruent to 0 modulo 3 for any integer n, that would mean 3 divides n\u00b3 + 2n.\n\nLet me consider different cases based on the possible remainders when n is divided by 3. Since any integer n can be expressed as one of 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3, I can check each case separately.\n\nCase 1: n \u2261 0 mod 3. That means n is a multiple of 3, so n = 3k for some integer k. Then, let's compute n\u00b3 + 2n.\n\nn\u00b3 = (3k)\u00b3 = 27k\u00b3, which is clearly divisible by 3. Then, 2n = 2*(3k) = 6k, which is also divisible by 3. So, n\u00b3 + 2n = 27k\u00b3 + 6k, which is 3*(9k\u00b3 + 2k). Therefore, it's divisible by 3. Okay, that case works.\n\nCase 2: n \u2261 1 mod 3. So, n can be written as 3k + 1 for some integer k. Let's compute n\u00b3 + 2n.\n\nFirst, n\u00b3 = (3k + 1)\u00b3. Let me expand that using the binomial theorem:\n\n(3k + 1)\u00b3 = 27k\u00b3 + 27k\u00b2 + 9k + 1. Now",
