I need to find the probability that exactly 7 students are assigned to group #1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each student is assigned randomly, so I'm dealing with some sort of probability distribution here. Since each student is assigned independently to one of the five groups, this seems like a multinomial distribution problem. Yeah, multinomial because we're dealing with multiple categories (the five project groups) and we want the probability of a specific number of outcomes in one category.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the multinomial probability mass function. It's given by:\n\nP(k\u2081, k\u2082, ..., k\u2099) = n! / (k\u2081! k\u2082! ... k\u2099!) * (p\u2081^k\u2081 p\u2082^k\u2082 ... p\u2099^k\u2099)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of trials (students in this case, so 30),\n- k\u2081, k\u2082, ..., k\u2099 are the number of outcomes in each category (the number of students in each group),\n- p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2099 are the probabilities of each outcome (which, since it's random assignment, each group has an equal chance, so p=1/5 for each group).\n\nWait, so in this case, we have five groups, so n=5 categories, but we're interested in exactly 7 students in group 1. So, k\u2081=7, and the rest (k\u2082, k\u2083, k\u2084, k\u2085) should be 30-7=23, but how are they distributed?

What is the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem: I need to find the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes when rolling a fair six-sided die 10 times. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials, especially with a fixed number of successes, the binomial probability formula is usually the way to go. Is this a binomial situation? Let me recall: a binomial experiment has two possible outcomes, usually called success and failure, and each trial is independent. In this case, rolling a six is a success, and not rolling a six is a failure. So yeah, that fits the binomial model.\n\nSo, the binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial,\n- n is the number of trials.\n\nIn this problem, rolling a six is a success, so p = 1/6, since a die has six sides. The number of trials, n, is 10 because we're rolling the die 10 times. And k is 3, because we want exactly 3 sixes.\n\nSo plugging into the formula, we get:\n\nP(3) = C(10, 3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^(10-3)\n\nLet me make sure I got that right. So, the combination part is choosing 3 successes out of 10 trials, which is C(10,3). The probability of getting 3 sixes is (1/6)^3, and the probability of getting 7 non-sixes is (5/6)^7. That makes sense because after getting ",

Hmm, let's see. I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided equally into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. So, there are 13 hearts in the deck.\n\nThe question is about drawing 5 cards and getting exactly 3 hearts. So, I think this is a hypergeometric probability problem because we're dealing with successes (hearts) and failures (non-hearts) without replacement.\n\nThe formula for hypergeometric probability is:\n\nP = (number of ways to choose the desired number of successes) \u00d7 (number of ways to choose the remaining from the failures) divided by the total number of ways to choose the total number of cards.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of ways to choose 3 hearts out of 13 is C(13,3), and the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 cards from the non-hearts, which are 39 in total. So, that would be C(39,2). Then, the total number of ways to choose any 5 cards from the deck is C(52,5).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP = [C(13,3) \u00d7 C(39,2)] / C(52,5)\n\nNow, I need to compute each of these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(n,k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k! \u00d7 (n - k)!).

I need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 2 blue marbles when I draw 4 marbles without replacement. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability problems like this often involve combinations because the order in which we draw the marbles doesn't matter. So, I should probably use combinations to figure out the number of ways to draw the desired marbles and then divide that by the total number of ways to draw any 4 marbles from the bag. That makes sense because probability is about the favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n\nLet me write down the given numbers: 8 red, 5 blue, and 7 green. So, the total number of marbles is 8 + 5 + 7, which is 20 marbles in total. Okay, so when I draw 4 marbles, the total number of possible ways is the combination of 20 marbles taken 4 at a time. I can write that as C(20, 4). I think the formula for combinations is n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number and k is the number we're choosing. So, C(20, 4) would be 20! / (4! * 16!). I can calculate that later, but maybe I'll leave it as C(20,4) for now.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are drawing exactly 2 red marbles and 2 blue marbles.

Alice goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Alice wins the game. Hmm, let's see.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. The game is straightforward: they flip a fair coin, which means the probability of getting heads (H) is 0.5 and tails (T) is also 0.5 on each flip. Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on until someone gets heads.\n\nI think this is a probability problem that can be solved using an infinite series or maybe recursion. Let me think about how the game can progress.\n\nFirst, what's the probability that Alice wins on her first flip? Well, if she flips heads right away, she wins. The probability of that is 1/2.\n\nBut if she flips tails, which is also a probability of 1/2, then Bob gets a chance to flip. Now, if Bob flips heads, he wins, and Alice loses. If Bob also flips tails, then it's back to Alice, and the game continues.\n\nSo, the game can go on for multiple rounds. Let me try to model this step by step.\n\nLet me denote P as the probability that Alice wins the game. So, what's P?\n\nOn the first turn, Alice flips. There's a 1/2 chance she gets heads and wins immediately. If she gets tails (1/2 chance), then Bob gets to flip. Now, Bob has a 1/2 chance to flip heads and win, and a 1/2 chance to flip tails, which means the game goes back to Alice.\n\nSo, in the scenario where Alice flips tails and Bob flips tails, it's essentially the same situation as the beginning, but one turn later.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that often it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1.

The total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs out of 10 is given by the combination formula, which is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, that would be C(10, 4).

In this case, flipping a coin 8 times, each flip is a trial, getting heads is a success with probability p=0.6, and tails is a failure with probability q=1-p=0.4.\n\nI need to find the probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 8 flips.

Hmm, I remember something about the birthday problem from probability, but I'm not exactly sure how it works. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says there are 23 people and each has a birthday that can be any of 365 days, equally likely. So, each person has a 1 in 365 chance for each day. I think the key here is to calculate the probability that everyone has a unique birthday and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nLet me recall, when calculating probabilities involving \"at least,\" it's often easier to find the probability of the complementary event and then subtract from 1. So, the complementary event here is that all 23 people have unique birthdays. So, I need to find the probability that all 23 birthdays are different and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least two share a birthday.\n\nAlright, so how do I calculate the probability that all birthdays are unique? Well, for the first person, there are 365 possible birthdays. For the second person, since they can't share the first person's birthday, there are 364 possible birthdays left. For the third person, there are 363, and so on, down to the 23rd person, who would have 365 - 22 = 343 possible birthdays.\n\nSo, the number of ways this can happen is 365 * 364 * 363 * ... * (365 - 22). That seems like a factorial, but since we're stopping at 23, it's actually a permutation. So, it's 365P23.

It's just about how many aces are in the four cards drawn. So, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, unlike permutations where order does matter.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]Let me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n without considering order is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]So, in this case, I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 aces out of 4, and then the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 cards from the non-ace cards.[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"]First, let's calculate the number of ways to choose the 2 aces. There are 4 aces in the deck, so that's C(4, 2). Then, for the other two cards, since we don't want any more aces, we need to choose from the non-ace cards. There are 52 - 4 = 48 non-ace cards. So, that's C(48, 2).[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is C(4, 2) multiplied by C(48, 2).[\"end-section\"]"

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving conditional probability. Maybe I can use Markov chains or something like that. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the problem. It says that in this city, it rains on 30% of the days. So, the probability that it rains on any given day is 0.3, and the probability that it doesn't rain is 0.7. Now, there are some additional conditions: if it rains today, there's a 70% chance it will rain tomorrow; if it doesn't rain today, there's a 20% chance it will rain tomorrow. So, the probability of rain tomorrow depends on whether it's raining today or not.\n\nWait, so this is a Markov process with two states: Rain (R) and No Rain (NR). The transition probabilities are given. So, if it's in state R today, the probability it will be in R tomorrow is 70%, or 0.7. If it's in NR today, the probability it will be in R tomorrow is 20%, or 0.2.\n\nGiven that, we can represent this as a transition matrix. Let me recall, the transition matrix for a Markov chain has the probabilities of moving from one state to another. So, the states are Rain and No Rain.\n\nLet me denote the states as R and NR. Then, the transition matrix P would look like this:\n\n\\[ P = \\begin{pmatrix} P(R \\rightarrow R) & P(R \\rightarrow NR) \\\\ P(NR \\rightarrow R) & P(NR \\rightarrow NR) \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n- From R, P(R \u2192 R) = 0.7, P(R \u2192 NR) = 1 - ",

I need to find the probability that if I draw three marbles without replacement, they will be drawn in the order red, green, blue. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but if I break them down step by step, I can handle them. So, since the marbles are being drawn without replacement, each draw affects the next. That means the probability changes each time because the total number of marbles decreases, and the number of marbles of each color also decreases as they are drawn.\n\nThe order here is specific: red first, then green, then blue. So, I need to calculate the probability of drawing a red marble first, then a green marble, and then a blue marble. Since each draw is dependent on the previous one, I should multiply the probabilities of each individual draw happening in sequence.\n\nLet me write down the numbers: there are 5 red marbles, 3 green, and 2 blue. So, in total, that's 5 + 3 + 2, which is 10 marbles altogether. Okay, so when I start drawing, the total number of marbles is 10.\n\nFirst draw: probability of red. There are 5 red marbles out of 10. So, probability of drawing red is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nAfter drawing a red marble, since we're not replacing it, the total number of marbles left is now 9.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards, right? So, 13 ranks, each with 4 suits. A full house is when you have three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Got it.\n\nSo, to find the probability, I need to figure out two things: the number of possible full house hands, and the total number of possible 5-card hands. Then, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes.\n\nLet me start with the total number of possible 5-card hands. Since the order doesn't matter in a hand, that's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing. So, in this case, n is 52 and k is 5.\n\nCalculating that, C(52, 5) = 52! / (5! * (52 - 5)! = 52! / (5! * 47!) Hmm, that's a huge number. Let me compute that. Maybe I can simplify it step by step. 52 choose 5 is a common combination, so I think it's 2,598,960. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 / 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

So, the drawing stops either when all red balls are drawn or all blue balls are drawn. The question is, what's the probability that the last ball drawn is red? Hmm.

The expectation formula is E[X] = 1/p, where X is the random variable representing the number of trials until the first success. So if p is 0.3, then E[X] should be 1 divided by 0.3, which is 10/3 or approximately 3.333...\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm not confusing this with something else. Sometimes people talk about the expected number of trials including the successful one, which would be the same as what I just calculated, or is it different? Hmm, no, actually, the expected number of trials until the first success is indeed 1/p. So, for example, if the probability is 0.5, you'd expect to get a success on average in 2 trials. That makes sense because on average, half the time you'd get it on the first try, a quarter on the second, and so on.\n\nLet me think about how to derive this expectation to make sure. The expectation E[X] is the sum over all possible values of x multiplied by their probabilities. So, in the geometric distribution, the probability that the first success occurs on the k-th trial is (1",

Let me read it again: \"A box contains 15 chips: 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green, and 3 yellow. You randomly select 3 chips without replacement. What is the probability that you select exactly one red chip and exactly one blue chip?\" Hmm, okay, so we're dealing with combinations here because the order of selection doesn't matter, right? It's about the specific types of chips we're picking, not the order in which we pick them.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of possible ways to select 3 chips from the 15. Since it's without replacement, the total number of possible combinations should be the combination of 15 chips taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be C(15, 3). Let me calculate that.\n\nC(15, 3) = 15! / (3! * (15 - 3)!) = (15 * 14 * 13) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (2730) / 6 = 455. So, 455 total possible ways to draw 3 chips.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of selecting exactly one red chip and exactly one blue chip.

So, the problem is about rolling a die until all six numbers have appeared. Let's denote the expected number of rolls as E. I need to find E.\n\nLet me break it down. When you start rolling, you might get a number you've already seen before or a new one. Each time you roll, there's a 1/6 chance for each number. So, maybe I can model this as a series of stages.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand what the problem is asking. We have 20 students, each choosing two initials, one for the first name and one for the last name. Each initial is randomly selected from the 26 letters in the alphabet. We need to find the probability that at least two students end up with the same first and last initials. So, like, at least two students have the same first initial and the same last initial.\n\nHmm, okay. So, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that often it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and then subtract it from 1. The complement of \"at least two students have the same initials\" is \"all students have unique initials.\" So maybe I can calculate the probability that all 20 students have unique initials and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nAlright, so let me break it down. Each student has two initials: one for first name and one for last name. Each initial is chosen independently from 26 letters, right? So, for the first initial, there are 26 choices, and for the last initial, also 26 choices. So, for each student, the number of possible pairs of initials is 26 multiplied by 26, which is 676. So, 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations.\n\nNow, if we have 20 students, each choosing one of these 676 possible pairs, the total number of possible combinations for all students is 676^20.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many ways to draw three balls such that their numbers add up to an even number, and then divide that by the total number of ways to draw any three balls.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of possible outcomes. Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 10, there are 10 balls in total. When we draw three without replacement, the number of possible combinations is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. So, there are 120 possible ways to draw three balls.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: the number of ways to draw three balls where their sum is even. Hmm, how do I figure that out?

Using a balance scale, what is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the counterfeit coin with certainty?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where there are 8 coins, and one of them is counterfeit. The counterfeit one is lighter than the others. I need to figure out the minimum number of weighings required to identify which one is counterfeit using a balance scale. Hmm, let's see.\n\nI remember something about this from my math class. I think it's related to information theory or something about dividing the possibilities. Let me think. Each time you use the balance scale, you can get three possible outcomes: left side is heavier, right side is heavier, or both sides are equal. So each weighing gives you some information, which should help narrow down the possibilities.\n\nWith 8 coins, how many different outcomes are possible? Well, each coin could be the counterfeit one, so that's 8 possible outcomes. Now, each weighing gives you 3 possible results, so the number of weighings needed should be the smallest number that, when multiplied by 3, is just enough to cover 8 possibilities.\n\nSo, mathematically, it's like solving for n in 3^n \u2265 8. Let's see, 3^1 is 3, which is less than 8. 3^2 is 9, which is more than 8. So, does that mean 2 weighings are enough? Wait, but let me think more carefully.\n\nIn the first weighing, if I divide the coins into three groups. Hmm, but 8 isn't divisible by 3. So maybe I need to divide them into groups as evenly as possible.

I need to find the probability that no two people exit at the same floor. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 10 floors in total, and the ground floor is considered the first floor. So, the people are exiting on floors 2 through 10. Each person is choosing a floor randomly, right? And we need the probability that all five people exit on different floors.\n\nSo, probability is about the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out two things: the total number of possible ways the five people can exit, and the number of those ways where each person exits on a different floor.\n\nStarting with the total number of possible outcomes. Each person has 9 choices (since they can't choose the ground floor). So, for the first person, there are 9 options, the second person also has 9, and so on. But wait, does the order matter here? Since each person is distinct, their choices are independent, so the total number of possible outcomes is 9 multiplied by itself 5 times, which is 9^5.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes = 9^5\n\nNow, for the number of favorable outcomes, where each person exits on a different floor.

I think this is a probability question involving sets and maybe some principles of inclusion-exclusion. Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst off, when dealing with probabilities of liking at least one of two products, I remember that it's often useful to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. That principle helps calculate the probability of either one event happening or another event happening, accounting for any overlap between them. So, in this case, the events are liking product A and liking product B. The formula I recall is:\n\nP(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2227 B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(A \u2228 B) is the probability of liking at least one product.\n- P(A) is the probability of liking product A.\n- P(B) is the probability of liking product B.\n- P(A \u2227 B) is the probability of liking both products.\n\nSo, plugging in the given values:\n- P(A) = 60% = 0.6\n- P(B) = 50% = 0.5\n- P(A \u2227 B) = 30% = 0.3\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the formula:\n\nP(A \u2228 B) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.3\n\nLet me do the math here. 0.6 plus 0.5 is 1.1, and then subtracting 0.3 gives 0.8.

I need to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 0.5. Hmm, interesting. I remember something about probability and birthdays, maybe it's the classic birthday problem? Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should recall how probability works in this scenario. Each person's birthday is like an independent event, right? So, each person has 365 possible days they could be born. The probability that any two people share the same birthday is based on how many possible pairs there are and the chance that they overlap.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. The problem is asking for the probability that at least two people share a birthday to be greater than 0.5. That means I need to find the smallest n where P(at least two share) > 0.5. Hmm, how do I calculate that?\n\nI remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and then subtract it from 1. The complement of at least two people sharing a birthday is that all people have unique birthdays, right? So, if I calculate 1 - P(all birthdays are unique) > 0.5, then I can solve for n.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, let's denote P(unique) as the probability that all n people have different birthdays.

What is the probability that the values shown form a geometric sequence?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability that when I roll three fair six-sided dice, the numbers shown form a geometric sequence. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio. So, if I have three numbers a, b, c, they form a geometric sequence if b/a = c/b, which means b squared equals a times c, or b\u00b2 = a*c.\n\nAlright, so with three dice, each die can roll a number from 1 to 6. Since the dice are fair, each outcome is equally likely, with a probability of 1/6 for each number. But I don't need to calculate probability yet; first, I need to figure out how many possible outcomes form a geometric sequence.\n\nLet me denote the three dice as die 1, die 2, and die 3, which show the numbers a, b, c respectively. So, I need to find all ordered triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are integers from 1 to 6 and satisfy the condition that b\u00b2 = a*c.\n\nSince the dice are distinguishable, the order matters here. So, for example, (1, 2, 4) is different from (4, 2, 1) even though they have the same numbers. But in terms of geometric sequences, both could potentially form a geometric sequence if they satisfy the ratio condition.\n\nWait, actually, (1, 2, 4) has a common ratio of 2, so that's a geometric sequence, while (4, 2, 1) has a common ratio of 1/2, which is also a geometric sequence. So, both are valid, but they are different ordered triples.\n\nSo, I",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expectation problems often involve probability and maybe some combinatorial thinking. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, a standard deck has 52 cards, with 4 aces. So, the deck is well-shuffled, meaning each card has an equal chance of being in any position when drawn. The question is about the expected number of cards drawn until the first ace shows up. That means I need to figure out, on average, how many cards I'll draw before I see an ace for the first time.\n\nI think this is similar to the concept of expected value in probability. The expected value is like the average outcome we would expect if we were to perform an experiment many times. So, in this case, if I were to draw cards many times, the average number of cards drawn until the first ace would be the expected value I'm looking for.\n\nLet me consider the possible scenarios. When I draw a card, there are two possibilities: either it's an ace or it isn't. If it's an ace, the game stops, and the number of cards drawn is whatever it was at that point. If it's not an ace, the game continues, and I have to draw another card. So, this sounds like a geometric distribution problem.\n\nWait, what's a geometric distribution? I recall it's a probability distribution that models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials. In this case, a \"success\" would be drawing an ace, and a \"failure\" would be drawing a non-ace. So yes, this seems applicable.\n\nIn the geometric distribution, the expected value (mean) is given by 1/p, where p is the probability",

Alice goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Alice wins. Hmm, let's see. I think I can model this as a probability problem with two players, Alice and Bob, flipping a fair coin until one of them gets heads. Since it's a fair coin, the probability of getting heads on each toss is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5.\n\nLet me break it down. Since Alice goes first, she has the first chance to win on the first toss. If she gets heads, she wins immediately. If she gets tails, then Bob gets a chance to toss the coin. If Bob gets heads, he wins; if he also gets tails, then it goes back to Alice, and the game continues.\n\nSo, the game can potentially go on for multiple rounds. I think I can represent this as an infinite series where each round is a trial, and we calculate the probability that Alice wins on the first round, the third round, the fifth round, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the probability that Alice wins as P. On her first turn, she can win with probability 0.5. If she doesn't win (which is also 0.5 probability), then Bob gets a chance. Bob can win with probability 0.5, but if he also doesn't win (again, 0.5), then it's back to Alice. So, effectively, the game can be seen as repeating itself after each pair of tails.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice wins can be thought of as the probability that she wins on her first turn plus the probability that both she and Bob get tails and then she wins from there.

Initially, there are 10 red and 10 blue marbles. Each time I draw a marble, I put it back into the jar along with another marble of the same color. So, if I draw a red marble, I put it back and add another red marble. Similarly, if I draw a blue one, I put it back and add another blue.

I need to find the probability that exactly one bin remains empty. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probability problems involving distributing objects into bins, it often involves combinatorics, specifically permutations and combinations. Since each ball is placed independently into any of the five bins with equal probability, the total number of possible distributions is 5^5, because each ball has five choices. Let me calculate that: 5\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75\u00d75 is 3125. So, there are 3125 total possible ways the balls can be placed into the bins.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one bin remains empty. That means four bins have at least one ball each, and one bin is empty. So, I need to find the number of ways this can happen and then divide that by the total number of distributions, which is 3125.\n\nTo find the number of favorable distributions, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or maybe some combinatorial counting. Let me recall. If I want exactly one bin empty, I can choose which bin is empty first, right? So, there are 5 choices for which bin is empty.\n\nOnce I've chosen the empty bin, I need to distribute the five balls into the remaining four bins, ensuring that each of these four bins has at least one ball.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, when I see \"probability of hitting at least 8 times,\" that makes me think of the binomial probability formula because we're dealing with a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: hit or miss. The probability of success (hitting the target) is 0.7, and the probability of failure (missing) would then be 1 - 0.7, which is 0.3.\n\nSo, for a binomial distribution, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. In this case, n is 10 shots, and k is the number of hits we want. But the problem says \"at least 8 times,\" which means we need to consider the probabilities of hitting exactly 8, exactly 9, or exactly 10 times.

Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The question is: \"A virus scanner has a 99% probability of detecting a virus if one is present, and a 2% probability of falsely indicating that a virus is present when none is. If 1% of all files actually contain a virus, what is the probability that a file contains a virus given that the scanner indicates a virus is present?\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find the probability that a file has a virus given that the scanner says it does. That sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B), where A is the event that the file has a virus, and B is the event that the scanner indicates a virus.\n\nSo, translating that into this problem, A is the file having a virus, and B is the scanner indicating a virus. So, P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).\n\nAlright, I need to figure out P(A and B) and P(B). I know that P(A) is the probability that a file actually has a virus, which is given as 1%. So, P(A) = 0.01.\n\nNow, P(B), the probability that the scanner indicates a virus, can be broken down into two parts: the probability that the scanner correctly identifies a virus and the probability that it incorrectly flags a clean file as having a virus. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly.

I need to find the probability that if I draw three marbles without replacement, all three will be different colors. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, it's often helpful to use combinations to figure out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, maybe I should calculate the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles from the bag, and then figure out how many of those combinations have all three different colors.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of marbles. There are 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles, so that's 3 + 4 + 5. Let me add that up: 3 + 4 is 7, and 7 + 5 is 12. So, there are 12 marbles in total. \n\nNow, the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles from 12 is given by the combination formula, which is \"12 choose 3.\" The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing.

Alice goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Alice wins. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the game is a series of coin flips. Each flip is independent, and since it's a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (H) is 0.5, and the probability of getting tails (T) is also 0.5. Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on until someone gets tails.\n\nSo, let's think about how this game can play out. On the first turn, Alice flips the coin. If she gets tails, she wins immediately. The probability of that happening is 0.5. If she gets heads, then Bob gets a chance to flip. If Bob flips tails, he wins; that's another 0.5 probability. If Bob also gets heads, then it goes back to Alice. So, the game can go on for multiple rounds.\n\nThis seems like an infinite series because theoretically, the game could, in theory, go on forever, although the probability of that happening gets really small each time. So, maybe I can model this as an infinite geometric series where each term represents a round of flipping.\n\nLet me denote the probability that Alice wins as P. Let's try to express P in terms of itself. On her first turn, Alice can either win immediately or pass the turn to Bob. If she gets tails, which is 0.5, she wins. If she gets heads, which is also 0.5, then Bob gets to flip. Now, if Bob flips tails, he wins, so Alice loses.

Let me recall, the hypergeometric distribution is used when we're sampling without replacement from a finite population, which seems to fit here because we're taking a random sample of 50 records from 1000. So, yeah, hypergeometric distribution makes sense.\n\nIn the hypergeometric distribution, the probability of k successes (in this case, finding corrupted records) in n draws (50) from a finite population (1000) without replacement, where there are K successes in the population (10 corrupted records) is given by the formula:\n\nP(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the population size (1000)\n- K is the number of successes in the population (10)\n- n is the number of draws (50)\n- k is the number of observed successes (2)\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nN = 1000\nK = 10\nn = 50\nk = 2\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\nP(X = 2) = [C(10, 2) * C(990, 48)] / C(1000, 50)\n\nAlright, now I need to compute each of these combinations.

The question is asking for the probability that the student gets exactly 4 questions right. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me break it down. There are 5 questions in total. The student knows 2, so those are definitely correct, right? So that gives them 2 correct answers for sure. Then, for the other 3, they have to guess, and each has a 1/4 chance of being correct because there are 4 options, only one is right.\n\nSo, the student is already guaranteed 2 correct answers, and then they have 3 more where they can get some correct and some incorrect. The question is about getting exactly 4 correct in total. That means, since they already have 2, they need to get exactly 2 more correct out of those 3 guessed questions. Because 2 + 2 = 4. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if they need exactly 4 correct, and they already have 2, they need 2 more correct from the 3 guessed ones. But each guessed question is either correct or incorrect.

That means the buses come at 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, and so on. A passenger arrives at the bus stop at a random time between 12:00 and 1:00, and I need to find the expected waiting time for the next bus. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expected value, especially in cases like this, it's often useful to model the problem over a time interval and then calculate the average waiting time. Since the buses come every 15 minutes, the schedule is periodic with a period of 15 minutes. So, the problem has a sort of repeating pattern every 15 minutes.\n\nNow, the passenger can arrive at any time between 12:00 and 1:00, which is a 60-minute window. That gives me a uniform distribution of arrival times between 0 and 60 minutes past 12:00. I think this is a uniform distribution because the problem says the passenger arrives at a random time, so it's equally likely at any point within that hour.\n\nTo find the expected waiting time, I need to consider the waiting time for each possible arrival time and then take the average. Since the buses come every 15 minutes, the waiting time depends on when the passenger arrives relative to the last bus that just left or the next bus that's coming.\n\nLet me visualize this. If the passenger arrives exactly at 12:00, the next bus is at 12:15, so the waiting time is 15 minutes.

I need to find the probability that exactly one box contains exactly two balls, and no box contains more than two balls. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that since the balls are identical, the order in which they're placed doesn't matter. Each ball has an equal chance of going into any of the nine boxes, so the probability for each box is 1/9. But since the balls are placed independently, the placement of one ball doesn't affect the others. That makes me think that the total number of possible distributions is 9^10, since each of the ten balls has nine choices. So, the total number of possible configurations is 9^10.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one box has exactly two balls, and no box has more than two balls. So, in other words, we need exactly one box with two balls and the remaining eight boxes each have either one ball or zero balls. Wait, no, actually, since we have ten balls, if one box has two balls, the remaining eight balls must be distributed among the other eight boxes, but each of those boxes can have at most one ball. So, that means each of the remaining eight boxes must have exactly one ball each. Because if any of them had zero, that would mean another box would have two, which would violate the condition that no box has more than two balls. Hmm, actually, wait. If one box has two, and the remaining eight boxes must hold the remaining eight balls, each with no more than two. But since we have only eight balls left, and each of the remaining eight boxes can hold at most one, that means each must have exactly one. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in total",

Since the order of the cards doesn't matter, it's a combination, not a permutation. The total number of ways to deal the cards is the number of ways to divide 52 cards into four groups of 13 each. So, that should be the combination of 52 cards taken 13 at a time, and then multiplied by the combinations for the remaining 39 cards, and so on. Wait, no, that's more like multinomial coefficients. But actually, since each player gets exactly 13 cards, the total number of possible deals is 52 choose 13 times 39 choose 13 times 26 choose 13 times 13 choose 13, but that's a huge number. However, I remember that sometimes it's easier to think of it as 52! divided by (13!)^4, because we're dividing the deck into four equal groups.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to deal the cards is 52! / (13!^4).

The counterfeit is lighter than the others. I need to figure out the minimum number of weighings required on a balance scale to identify which one is counterfeit. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember something about using a balance scale to find a fake coin, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact method. Let me try to recall. I think it's similar to something with dividing the coins into groups and comparing them. Maybe something like splitting them into three groups each time? Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nSo, if I have 8 coins, and I want to use a balance scale, I can divide them into three groups. But wait, 8 isn't perfectly divisible by 3. Let me see, 3, 3, and 2?

Let me denote them as Group A, Group B, and Group C, with 3, 3, and 2 coins respectively.\n\nFirst, I would weigh Group A against Group B. If they balance, that means the counterfeit is in Group C. If they don't balance, the lighter side will have the counterfeit. So, after the first weighing, I can narrow it down to either 3 coins or 2 coins.\n\nWait, if they don't balance, the counterfeit is in the lighter group, which could be 3 coins. If they do balance, it's in the remaining 2 coins. So, in the second weighing, I need to figure out which one is counterfeit in that group.\n\nLet me outline the process step by step:\n\n1.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when calculating probabilities involving \"at least\" scenarios, it's often easier to use the complement rule. Instead of calculating the probability of matching 4, 5, or 6 numbers directly, I can calculate the probability of the opposite events (like matching fewer than 4 numbers) and then subtract that from 1. That should give me the probability of matching at least 4 numbers. \n\nSo, the total number of possible lottery tickets is the number of ways to choose 6 numbers out of 49, which is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!) where n is the total number and k is the number we're choosing. So, the total number of possible tickets is C(49, 6).\n\nNow, for the event where we don't match at least 4 numbers, that means we match 0, 1, 2, or 3 numbers.

Because if we stop when all balls of one color are drawn, then the last ball drawn would be the last of that color. So, if the last ball is red, it means all red balls have been drawn, and the process stops. Similarly, if the last ball is green, that would mean all green balls have been drawn, and the process stops. So, the problem is essentially asking for the probability that the last red ball is drawn before the last green ball. Or, in other words, the probability that the last ball left in the urn is green. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, not exactly. Because the process stops when all balls of one color are drawn, so the last ball drawn would be the last of that color.

I need to figure out the probability of winning. Hmm, probability problems can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me think about what it means to get at least four of the same number when rolling five dice. That could mean getting exactly four of a kind or exactly five of a kind. So, I need to calculate the probability of both scenarios and then add them together to get the total probability of winning.\n\nTo start, I know that when dealing with probability, it's often useful to use combinations and permutations. Since dice are independent, each roll has 6 possible outcomes, so rolling five dice would result in 6^5 total possible outcomes. Let me calculate that. 6^5 is 6 multiplied by itself five times: 6\u00d76\u00d76\u00d76\u00d76. Let me compute that: 6\u00d76 is 36, 36\u00d76 is 216, 216\u00d76 is 1296, and 1296\u00d76 is 7776. So, there are 7776 possible outcomes when rolling five dice.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where I get at least four dice showing the same number. As I thought earlier, this includes two cases: exactly four of a kind and exactly five of a kind.\n\nStarting with exactly five of a kind, that's straightforward. There are only six possible numbers on a die (1 through 6), and if all five dice show the same number, there's only one way for each number. So, for exactly five of a kind, the number of favorable outcomes is 6 (since any one of the six numbers could be the one that shows up five times).\n\nNext, let's tackle exactly four of a kind.

So, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote the probability that Alice wins as P. Since Alice goes first, she has the first chance to roll a 6. If she rolls a 6, she wins immediately, right? The probability of that happening is 1/6. But if she doesn't roll a 6, which is a 5/6 chance, then Bob gets to roll.

But if Bob also doesn't roll a 6, which is another 5/6 chance, then it's back to Alice, and the situation is just like the beginning.\n\nSo, let me put that into an equation. The probability that Alice wins, P, can be expressed as the probability she wins on her first roll plus the probability that both she and Bob don't roll a 6, and then she gets another chance.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the probability that out of these 7 socks, at least one color is repeated. \n\nHmm, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. The opposite of having at least one matching pair would be having no matching pairs, meaning all 7 socks are of different colors. So, if I can find the probability of all socks being different, then subtracting that from 1 should give me the probability of having at least one matching pair. That seems like a plan.\n\nSo, first, let's think about the total number of ways to choose 7 socks out of 20. That should be a combination problem because the order in which we pick the socks doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So, the total number of possible ways to pick 7 socks is C(20, 7). Let me calculate that.\n\nCalculating C(20,7): 20! / (7! * (20 - 7)!) = 20! / (7! * 13!)

Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nWe have three people standing in a line. Each person is assigned a hat, and each hat can be either red or blue, each with a probability of 1/2. The assignment is random, so each hat color is equally likely. Now, each person can see the hats of the people in front of them but not their own or anyone behind them. They start guessing their hat color from the back of the line, which means the first person to guess is the one at the very front, followed by the middle person, and then the last person at the back.\n\nThe goal is to determine the strategy that maximizes the probability that at least two people guess correctly. Hmm, interesting. So, we need to figure out what each person should do when it's their turn to guess, based on what they see in front of them, to maximize the chance that at least two of them are correct.\n\nLet me break this down step by step. Let's denote the three people as Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3, standing from front to back. Person 1 can see the hats of Persons 2 and 3. Person 2 can see only Person 3's hat, and Person 3 can't see anyone.\n\nEach person has to guess their own hat color. The guessing happens in order: Person 1 goes first, then Person 2, then Person 3. Since each person can only see those in front, each has some information when it's their turn to guess.\n\nThe key here is that their guesses are based on what they see. So, Person 1 has more information than Person 2, who in turn has more information than Person 3. But since the hats are assigned randomly, each with a 50-50 chance, the optimal strategy must",

If the coin is flipped repeatedly, what is the probability that the 3rd head appears on the 5th flip? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. They want the probability that the third head happens on the fifth flip. That means, in the first four flips, we must have exactly two heads, and then the fifth flip is a head. So, the sequence would look like H, H, T, T, H or some permutation where the first four flips have exactly two heads and the fifth is a head. Wait, no, actually, it's not necessarily the first four flips. It could be any combination where the third head is on the fifth flip. So, in the first four flips, there must be exactly two heads, and then the fifth flip is the third head.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to calculating the probability of getting exactly two heads in the first four flips and then a head on the fifth flip. Since each flip is independent, the probability of getting two heads in four flips is a binomial probability, and then we multiply that by the probability of getting a head on the fifth flip.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nThe probability of getting exactly k successes (heads) in n trials is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, p is the probability of success on a single trial, and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\nIn this case, n is 4 (since we're considering the first four flips), k is 2 (since we need exactly two heads), p is 0.7.\n\nSo, the probability",

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Monty Hall problem is about. It's a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. You're given the choice of three doors, one of which has a car, and the other two have goats. You pick a door, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat, and then offers you the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door. The question is, should you switch or stick with your original choice? And if you switch, what's the probability you win?\n\nAlright, so let me try to visualize this. There are three doors: let's call them Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3. Behind one of these doors is a car, and the other two have goats. You pick one door, say Door A. The host, who knows where the car is, opens another door, say Door B, revealing a goat. Then you have the option to switch to the remaining unopened door, which would be Door C.\n\nNow, the initial probability of winning the car by sticking with your first choice is 1/3, right? Because there's only one car among three doors. So if I don't switch, my chance is 1/3.\n\nBut when I switch, what happens? The host has to open a door that doesn't have the car. So, if I initially picked a goat, the host will open the other goat door. That means switching would definitely get me the car. But if I initially picked the car, the host will have to open one of the two goat doors. So, I need to figure out the probability based on these two scenarios.\n\nLet me think in terms of conditional probability. When I",

When released, each dog independently finds the prey with probability 0.8. What is the probability that the prey is found if the hunter releases both dogs.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. So, the problem is about probability with two dogs, right? Each dog has an 80% chance of finding the prey on its own. And the hunter releases both dogs, so we need to find the probability that at least one of them finds the prey.\n\nHmm, so when dealing with probabilities of multiple events, especially independent ones, I remember that we can use the concept of independent events and maybe combine their probabilities. Since the dogs are released independently, the outcome of one doesn't affect the other. So, each dog has a 0.8 chance to find the prey, and a 0.2 chance not to find it.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the prey is found. So, that can happen in two scenarios: either the first dog finds it, or the second dog finds it, or both find it. So, it's like the probability of either event A or event B happening, which is the union of two events.\n\nI recall that the probability of A or B happening is equal to the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability of both A and B happening. So, in mathematical terms, that's P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSince the dogs are independent, the probability that both find the prey is the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). Let me write that down:\n\nP(found) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = 0.8 + 0.8 - (0.8",

What is the probability that the committee has more women than men? Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out how to calculate this. \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out all the possible ways to select 4 people from the group. Since there are 7 men and 5 women, that makes a total of 12 people. So the total number of possible committees is the combination of 12 people taken 4 at a time. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! (n - r)!), where n is the total number and r is how many we're choosing. So, 12C4.\n\nLet me calculate that. 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9) / (4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 495. So there are 495 possible committees.\n\nNow, I need to find how many committees have more women than men. That means the number of women in the committee is greater than the number of men. Since we're selecting 4 people, the possible distributions where women are more are when there are 3 women and 1 man, or 4 women and 0 men. So I need to calculate the number of committees for both these cases and add them together.\n\nLet me start with 3 women and 1 man. The number of ways to choose 3 women from 5 is 5C3, and the number of ways to choose 1 man from 7 is 7C1. Multiplying these together gives the number of committees with 3 women and 1 man.\n\nCalculating 5C3: 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5 \u00d7 4)",

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, when I see \"each number exactly once,\" that makes me think of permutations because the order in which the numbers appear matters here. Since each roll is independent, the die has six sides, and we're rolling it six times. So, the total number of possible outcomes should be 6^6, right? Let me calculate that. 6 multiplied by itself six times is 6*6*6*6*6*6. Let me compute that:\n\n6^6 = 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6\n\nCalculating step by step: 6\u00d76=36, 36\u00d76=216, 216\u00d76=1296, 1296\u00d76=7776, 7776\u00d76=46656. So, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die six times is 46,656. Got that.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where each number is rolled exactly once. That is, each number from 1 to 6 appears once in six rolls. Hmm, so this is like arranging six distinct numbers where each number is unique.

I need to figure out the expected number of keys I'll try on average before I find the correct one. Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, expectation is like the average outcome we'd expect over many trials. So, if I were to try all 7 keys one by one, without replacement, the expected number of tries would be... hmm, maybe I can model this somehow.\n\nLet me recall some probability concepts. I remember something about expected value for geometric distributions. The geometric distribution gives the probability that the first success in a series of independent trials occurs on the nth trial. But wait, in this case, each trial isn't independent because once I try a key, I don't put it back. So, without replacement, each trial is dependent on the previous ones. Hmm, so maybe it's not a geometric distribution.\n\nWait, but maybe I can still use some similar reasoning. Let me think. The probability of success on each trial is changing because each time I try a key, I remove it from the pool, so the probability of the next key being correct decreases.\n\nLet me denote the expected number of trials as E. So, on the first try, I have 1 key, and the probability of success is 1/7. If I don't succeed on the first try, which happens with probability 6/7, then I move to the second key. The probability of success on the second try is 1/6, and so on.\n\nSo, the expectation can be broken down as the sum of the probabilities of each key being the one that works, multiplied by the number of tries required to get there.

The problem also mentions that there are 365 days in a year and birthdays are uniformly distributed. Hmm, okay. I remember that this is a classic birthday problem, but usually, it's about calculating the probability that at least two people share a birthday. This one is about three. Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the birthday problem is a common probability question where we calculate the chance that two or more people share the same birthday. The basic idea is that with 365 possible days, the probability increases as the number of people increases. So, in this case, we're looking for at least three people sharing a birthday, not just two.\n\nI think the standard approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here would be that no three students share the same birthday. So, if I can find the probability that no three students share a birthday, then 1 minus that probability will give me the probability that at least three do.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the birthday problem. For the probability that no two people share a birthday, the formula is:\n\nP(no two share) = 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - n + 1)/365\n\nWhere n is the number of people. But wait, that's for exactly one person not sharing, but actually, it's more precise to say that it's the probability that all birthdays are unique.\n\nSo, more accurately, the probability that all 30 students have distinct birthdays is:\n\nP(all unique) = 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365 * ... * (365 - 30 + 1)/365\n\nWhich simplifies to 365! / (365 -",

It says that two dice are rolled, and we're given that the sum is odd. Under this condition, we need to find the probability that at least one die shows a 3. So, it's a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.

So, I need to calculate P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, actually, is that correct? Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again. If A is \"at least one die shows a 3,\" and B is \"sum is odd,\" then actually, A isn't necessarily a subset of B. So, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think about the problem by considering the possible outcomes and their probabilities.

What is the probability that at least one of the four aces is in the top 5 cards?\" Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probability, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting it from 1. The opposite of \"at least one ace in the top 5\" would be \"no aces in the top 5.\" So maybe I can find the probability that none of the four aces are in the first five cards and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the probability of no aces in the top 5. There are 52 cards in total, and we're looking at the first five. The deck is shuffled, so each card has an equal chance of being in any position.\n\nSo, the first card: the probability that it's not an ace is... well, there are 48 non-ace cards. So, 48/52, which simplifies to 12/13. Similarly, for the second card, since one non-ace has already been taken, there are 47 non-ace cards left out of 51 total. So, 47/51. Wait, but hold on, is this the right approach?\n\nActually, maybe it's better to think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to have no aces in the top 5 divided by the total number of ways to have any 5-card combination. So, the number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is C(52,5). The number of ways to choose 5 cards with no aces is C(48,5), since we're excluding the four aces. So, the probability would be C(48,5)/C(",

Each player plays exactly one match against each of the other players. No ties, just wins and losses. I need to find the probability that exactly 3 players win exactly 4 matches each. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a round-robin tournament is. In such a tournament, each player plays every other player exactly once. So with 8 players, each player will play 7 matches. The total number of matches in the tournament can be calculated using combinations. Specifically, it's C(8,2), which is 28 matches. Since each match results in one win and one loss, there are also 28 wins and 28 losses distributed among the 8 players.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that exactly 3 players win exactly 4 matches each. Let me think about what this implies. If exactly 3 players have 4 wins each, then those 3 players account for 3*4 = 12 wins. The remaining 5 players must account for the remaining 28 - 12 = 16 wins. So, each of these remaining 5 players can have at most 4 wins, but since 16 divided by 5 is 3.2, which isn't an integer, that suggests that some of these 5 players will have 3 wins and some will have 4. But wait, actually, 5 players can have 3 wins each, that would be 15 wins, which is less than 16. Hmm, so that suggests that one of them must have 4 wins and the rest have 3. So, 1 player with 4 wins and 4 players with 3 wins among the remaining 5. But wait, let me check: 1*4 + 4*3 = 4 + 12",

If two balls are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that they are of different colors?\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, ratios can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I remember that ratios tell us how parts relate to each other. So, the ratio of red to blue to green is 2:3:5. That means for every 2 red balls, there are 3 blue and 5 green. I need to find the total number of balls first, right?\n\nLet me denote the number of red balls as 2x, blue as 3x, and green as 5x, where x is a common multiplier. So, the total number of balls is 2x + 3x + 5x, which is 10x. That makes sense because 2+3+5 is 10, so the total is 10x.\n\nNow, the problem says we draw two balls without replacement. I need to find the probability that they are of different colors. Hmm, probability is usually favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. So, the total number of ways to draw two balls is the combination of 10x taken 2 at a time, which is C(10x, 2). The formula for combinations is n! / (k!(n - k)!), so that would be (10x * (10x - 1)) / 2. I think that's right.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes, which are the number of ways to draw two balls of different colors. Hmm, how do I calculate that?

The question is asking for the value of p that maximizes the probability of getting a code with exactly 3 ones. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of getting exactly k successes in n trials, we can use the binomial probability formula. In this case, each digit is like a trial, so n is 5. The number of ones in the code is the number of successes, so k is 3. The probability of success (choosing a 1) is p, and the probability of failure (choosing a 0) is 1-p.\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 3 ones in 5 digits should be given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So in this case, it would be C(5, 3) * p^3 * (1-p)^2.\n\nLet me compute C(5, 3) first. C(5,3) is 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = (5*4*3!)/(3! * 2!) = (5*4)/2 = 10. So, C(5,3) is 10.\n\nSo, the probability P(3) = 10 * p^3 * (1-p)^2.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the value of p that maximizes this probability.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, I remember that expectation is like the average outcome we'd expect over many trials. So, in this case, each card we turn over is a trial, and the outcome we're interested in is whether it's a heart or not. The first time we see a heart is what we're waiting for, so this seems like a problem that involves probability and maybe some kind of average.\n\nI think this might be related to the concept of expected value. The expected value can be calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing them up. In this case, the outcomes are the number of cards turned over until the first heart, which can be anywhere from 1 to 52. So, the expected value E would be the sum from k=1 to k=52 of k times the probability that the first heart appears on the k-th card.\n\nMathematically, that would be E = \u03a3 (k * P(k)) for k=1 to 52, where P(k) is the probability that the first heart appears on the k-th card. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what P(k) is for each k.\n\nWhat's P(k)? Well, if the first heart appears on the k-th card, that means the first k-1 cards are not hearts, and the k-th card is a heart. Since the deck has 13 hearts in total, the probability that the first k-1 cards are not hearts is the same as the probability that those k-1 cards are from the other 39 cards (since there are 52 - 13 = 39 non-heart cards). \n\nSo, the probability that the first k-1 cards are",

            "steered_chain": "<\uff5cUser\uff5c>A box contains 20 light bulbs, of which 4 are defective. If 6 bulbs are selected at random without replacement, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them are defective?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this probability problem here: there's a box with 20 light bulbs, and 4 of them are defective. I need to find the probability that if I select 6 bulbs at random without replacement, exactly 2 of them are defective. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability problems like this often involve combinations because the order in which we select the bulbs doesn't matter. So, I should probably use combinations to figure out the number of ways to choose the defective and non-defective bulbs.\n\nLet me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, for example, 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.\n\nAlright, so in this problem, we have 20 bulbs total, 4 defective, and 16 non-defective. We are selecting 6 bulbs, and we want exactly 2 of them to be defective. That means the other 4 should be non-defective.\n\nSo, I think the probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of ways to select 6 bulbs from 20 is C(20, 6). The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 2 defective bulbs from 4 and 4 non-defective bulbs from 16.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{C(4, 2) \\times C(16, 4)}{C(20, 6)}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute C",

What is the probability that the next toss will also be heads?\" Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with coin tosses, each toss is an independent event. That means the outcome of one toss doesn't affect the next one. So, if I have a fair coin, the probability of getting heads on any toss is 1/2, right? And the probability of tails is also 1/2. But this question is about getting 10 heads in a row and then asking the probability of another head. Hmm.\n\nWait, is this a conditional probability question? It seems like it. So, we need to find the probability that the next toss is heads given that the previous 10 were heads. That is, P(Heads on next toss | previous 10 were heads). \n\nOkay, so conditional probability formula is P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). In this case, event A is getting a head on the next toss, and event B is getting 10 heads in a row. So, A \u2229 B would be getting 11 heads in a row, right? Because if the next toss is also heads, then it's 11 in a row. \n\nSo, P(A|B) = P(11 heads in a row) / P(10 heads in a row). \n\nNow, I need to figure out these two probabilities. Since each coin toss is independent, the probability of getting 10 heads in a row is (1/2)^10, because each toss is independent. Similarly, the probability of getting 11 heads in a row is (1/2)^11. \n\nSo, plugging these into the formula, we get P(A|B) = (1/2)^11",

So, I need to figure out two things: how many total possible ways there are to draw 5 numbers from 35, and how many of those ways result in exactly 3 numbers matching my selection.\n\nStarting with the total number of possible outcomes. Since the lottery is without replacement, the order doesn't matter here. That means I can use combinations to calculate this. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 5 numbers out of 35 is C(35, 5). Let me compute that. Calculating factorials for large numbers can be tedious, but I remember that C(n, k) can also be calculated as n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers: 35! / (5! * (35 - 5)! which is 35! / (5! * 30!). \n\nBut wait, 35! is a huge number. Maybe I can simplify this before computing. Let me write it out:\n\nC(35, 5) = 35! / (5! * 30!) = (35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). That's because 35! / 30! cancels out all",

The components are shipped in boxes of 200. What is the probability that a box contains at least one defective component? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of defects in large numbers, the binomial probability formula might be useful here. The binomial formula is used when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. In this case, each component can be considered a trial, where \"success\" is a defective component and \"failure\" is a good one.\n\nThe problem states that the defect rate is 0.5%, which is the probability of a defective component, so p = 0.005. The components are shipped in boxes of 200, so n = 200. We need to find the probability that a box contains at least one defective component. That means we're looking for P(at least 1 defective) in 200 trials.\n\nBut calculating the probability of at least one defective directly might be complicated because there are many ways this could happen\u20141 defective, 2 defectives, up to 200 defectives. Instead, I recall that it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. The complementary event here is that the box contains no defective components, which is P(no defectives). So, P(at least 1 defective) = 1 - P(no defectives).\n\nTo find P(no defectives), we can use the binomial probability formula for exactly k successes (in this case, 0 defectives). The formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So, for k = 0,",

What is the probability of getting at least one run of at least 3 consecutive heads. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving sequences like this, it might be helpful to use the concept of complementary probability. Instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one run of 3 heads directly, maybe I can calculate the probability of the opposite event, i.e., the probability of not getting any run of 3 consecutive heads, and then subtract that from 1. That might be easier because sometimes it's simpler to count the cases where something doesn't happen.\n\nSo, let's define our events. Let\u2019s denote the total number of possible outcomes when tossing a coin 10 times. Since each toss has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of possible sequences is 2^10, which is 1024. That seems right because for each toss, the number of outcomes doubles, so 2*2*...*2 ten times is 1024.\n\nNow, the complementary event we're interested in is the probability that in 10 coin tosses, there are no 3 consecutive heads. So, we need to count the number of sequences of 10 coin tosses with no 3 H's in a row, and then divide that by the total number of sequences, which is 1024. Then, subtract that probability from 1 to get our desired probability.\n\nHmm, how do I count the number of sequences with no 3 consecutive heads?

We're drawing them one at a time without replacement, which means once a marble is drawn, it's not put back into the bag. The question is asking for the probability that the 5th marble drawn is red.\n\nHmm, okay. So, probability without replacement. I remember that for probability problems like this, especially with drawing without replacement, the probability changes each time because the total number of marbles decreases and so does the number of the specific type of marble you're looking for.\n\nSo, for the first draw, the probability of drawing a red marble is 4 out of 10, or 2/5.

So, depending on how many red marbles have been drawn in those first four draws, the probability changes.\n\nWait, so I think I need to consider all the different scenarios of how many red marbles could have been drawn in the first four draws. Since we're drawing without replacement, the number of red marbles drawn can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Describe a method to do this and explain why it works.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this biased coin that lands heads with probability p, and I want to use it to simulate a fair coin toss. Hmm, how do I do that? I mean, a fair coin should have a 50-50 chance of landing heads or tails, right? But my coin is biased, so it's not reliable. I need a method that transforms the biased coin into a fair one. \n\nLet me think. Maybe I can flip the coin multiple times and use some kind of averaging or something? Like, if I flip it many times, the results will even out? But wait, if p isn't 0.5, flipping it many times won't necessarily make it fair. For example, if p is 0.3, it's more likely to land tails, so flipping it twice would just give me more tails. That won't help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of expected value. The expected number of heads in n flips is n*p. So, if I flip the coin n times, I can somehow use that to make a fair coin. But how?\n\nOh! Maybe I can use a method where I flip the biased coin twice and then decide what to do based on the results. Let me try to work this out. So, if I flip it twice, there are four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT. Each with certain probabilities.\n\nGiven that the coin is biased, the probabilities aren't equal. So, the probability of HH is p*p = p\u00b2, HT is p*(1-p), TH is (1-p)*p, and TT is (1-p)\u00b2. Now, if I get HH or TT, I can interpret that as a head; otherwise, I can flip again. Hmm, that might work.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I flip twice, and if both are the same, I can take that as a head, otherwise, I flip again",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that in bridge, each player gets 13 cards. There are four suits in a deck: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of possible ways to deal the cards. Since the deck has 52 cards, and each player gets 13, the total number of ways to deal the cards is the number of ways to divide 52 cards into four hands of 13 each. I think this is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), right?\n\nSo, the total number of ways to deal the deck is C(52,13) for the first player, then C(39,13) for the next player, and so on. But wait, since the order of the players doesn't matter, maybe I should divide by 4! to account for the different orders. Hmm, but actually, in probability, when dealing with equally likely outcomes, sometimes it's better to think in terms of multinomial coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as the number of ways to distribute the 52 cards into four players, each getting 13.

I need to figure out the expected number of bulbs I'll have to pick one by one without replacement until I find a defective one. Hmm, sounds like an expected value problem. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expected value, it's often helpful to break the problem down into smaller parts. Maybe I can think about the probability of finding a defective bulb at each step and then sum up the expected number for each step. That might work.\n\nSo, let's denote the expected number of bulbs I need to pick as E. Now, when I start picking bulbs, the probability that the first bulb I pick is defective is 10 out of 100, which is 0.1 or 1/10. If I pick a defective one on the first try, then I only need to pick one bulb, so that contributes 1 * 0.1 to the expected value.\n\nBut if I don't pick a defective bulb on the first try, which would be a probability of 90/100 or 0.9, then I have to continue picking. In that case, I've already picked one bulb, so now there are 99 left, and still 10 defective bulbs. So now, the expected number from this point would be E again, but starting with 99 bulbs and 10 defective ones.\n\nWait, that seems recursive. So, the expected value E can be expressed as the probability of picking a defective bulb on the first try times 1 (since you only picked one) plus the probability of not picking a defective bulb times the expected number from the remaining bulbs. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nE = (10/100)*1 + (90/100)*E'\n\nWhere E' is the expected number starting with 99 bulbs. But wait",

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think this is a probability problem involving two binomial distributions because each player is taking a series of independent shots, and each shot is a Bernoulli trial with a certain probability of success. So, for Player A, the number of shots made, let's call it X, follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p=0.7. Similarly, for Player B, the number of shots made, which I'll denote as Y, follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p=0.8.\n\nNow, the question asks for the probability that they make the same number of shots. So, I need to find P(X = Y). That is, the probability that both players make exactly k shots, for some k, where k can range from 0 to n. So, essentially, I need to sum the probabilities that both make 0 shots, both make 1 shot, both make 2 shots, and so on, up to both making n shots.\n\nMathematically, that would be P(X = Y) = \u03a3 [P(X = k) * P(Y = k)] for k = 0 to n. Since the shots are independent, the joint probability P(X = k and Y = k) is just the product of the individual probabilities P(X = k) and P(Y = k). So, this makes sense.\n\nNow, recalling the formula for the binomial probability mass function, which is P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k), where C(n",
