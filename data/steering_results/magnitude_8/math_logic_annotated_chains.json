Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you square a number, whether it's odd or even affects the result. Let me recall some properties of odd and even numbers.\n\nFirst, let me remember what even and odd numbers are. An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, right? So, even numbers are like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. Odd numbers, on the other hand, are numbers that aren't divisible by 2 without a remainder, like 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\nNow, when you square an even number, what happens? Let me take an example. If I square 2, I get 4; squaring 4 gives 16; squaring 6 gives 36. All of these are even numbers. So, it seems like squaring an even number results in an even number. What about squaring an odd number? Let's see, 1 squared is 1, 3 squared is 9, 5 squared is 25. All of these are odd. So, it looks like squaring an odd number gives an odd number.\n\nWait, so if n squared is odd, then n must have been odd to begin with. That makes sense based on these examples. But I need to prove this formally, not just rely on examples.\n\nLet me recall how to express odd and even numbers in terms of integers. An even integer can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. An odd integer can be written as 2k + 1, also where k is an integer. So, let me try squaring both expressions.\n\nIf n is even, then n = 2k. So, n squared is (",

Hmm, I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, which means the original assumption must be false. So, if I want to prove that \u221a2 is irrational, I should start by assuming the opposite, which would be that \u221a2 is rational. \n\nAlright, let me write that down: Assume that \u221a2 is rational. If it's rational, then it can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b is not zero. So, \u221a2 = a/b. Then, squaring both sides should give me 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. \n\nIf I rearrange that, I get 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So, this means that a\u00b2 is twice b\u00b2.

But wait, a is supposed to be an integer, and \u221a2 is irrational. So, how can a be both an integer and a multiple of an irrational number? That seems contradictory because multiplying an irrational number by any integer still gives an irrational number, and you can't get an integer from that. \n\nHold on, let me think through that again.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I need to check the base case, which is typically n = 1. Let me plug in n = 1 into the formula. The series becomes just 1. On the other side, the formula gives 1*(3*1 - 1)/2, which is (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, 1 equals 1. That works, so the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) = k(3k - 1)/2. Then, I have to show that it also holds for k + 1, that is, 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) + (3(k + 1) - 2) equals (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the series correctly. Each term increases by 3, starting at 1. So the nth term is 1 + 3(n - 1) = 3n - 2. So, when n = 1, it's 1; n = 2, it's 4; n = 3, it's 7, and so on.

Hmm, let me write that down clearly. The statement is P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) \u2229 P(B). \n\nFirst, let me recall what a power set is. The power set of a set X, denoted P(X), is the set of all subsets of X. So, if A and B are sets, then P(A) contains all subsets of A, and P(B) contains all subsets of B. \n\nI remember that in set theory, the intersection of two sets is a set that contains all elements common to both sets. So, A \u2229 B would be all elements that are in both A and B. Similarly, the intersection of their power sets, P(A) \u2229 P(B), would be all subsets that are common to both P(A) and P(B). \n\nWait, so P(A) \u2229 P(B) is the set of all subsets that are subsets of both A and subsets of B. That is, these are subsets of A that are also subsets of B. But another way to think about that is that they are subsets of A \u2229 B. Because if a subset is a subset of both A and B, it must be a subset of their intersection. \n\nLet me test this with an example. Suppose A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Then, P(A) is {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}, and P(B) is {\u2205, {2}, {3}, {2,3}}. The intersection P(A) \u2229 P(B) would be the sets that are in both, which are \u2205 and {2}.

And I need to find out what conclusion can be drawn from these. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, let me recall some basic logic principles. I think this is a classic example of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The first premise is a conditional: If P, then Q. The second premise is the negation of Q: not Q. I remember that in logic, if you have a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, its contrapositive is not P \u2192 not Q, and they are logically equivalent. So, if P \u2192 Q is true and not Q is true, then not P must also be true. \n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, if it's raining (P) then the streets are wet (Q). So, P \u2192 Q. The contrapositive would be if the streets are not wet (not Q), then it is not raining (not P). So, not Q \u2192 not P. That seems right. \n\nSo, in this case, the second premise is not Q. So, if not Q is given, then according to the contrapositive, not P must follow. So, not P is \"It is not raining.\" Therefore, the conclusion should be that it is not raining. \n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using modus tollens? Yeah, modus tollens is a rule in propositional logic where if we have P \u2192 Q and not Q, then we can conclude not P.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually n=1, right? Let me check if it holds. If n=1, then 1\u00b3 - 1 is 1 - 1, which is 0. Zero divided by 3 is 0, which is an integer, so yes, the base case works.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that k\u00b3 - k is divisible by 3. Then, I have to show that (k+1)\u00b3 - (k+1) is also divisible by 3. \n\nLet me write down the expression for (k+1)\u00b3. I remember that (k+1)\u00b3 is equal to k\u00b3 + 3k\u00b2 + 3k + 1. So, (k+1)\u00b3 - (k+1) would be k\u00b3 + 3k\u00b2 + 3k + 1 - k - 1. Let me simplify that.\n\nSimplifying, the +1 and -1 cancel out, so it's k\u00b3 + 3k\u00b2 + 3k - k. Combine like terms: 3k\u00b2 + 3k - k is 3k\u00b2 + 2k. So, now we have k\u00b3 + 3k\u00b2 + 2k.\n\nFrom the inductive hypothesis, we know that k\u00b3 - k is divisible by 3. That is, k\u00b3 - k = 3m for some integer m. So, maybe I can express (k+1)\u00b3 - (k+1) in terms",

Hmm, I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. I need to show that no matter how far out you go in the number line, there's always another prime number waiting. That sounds tricky, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nI've heard of Euclid's proof for this, right? Let me recall how that goes. Euclid assumed that there were only finitely many primes, say p1, p2, p3, up to pn. Then he multiplied them all together and added 1. So, the number would be p1 * p2 * ... * pn + 1. If this number isn't prime, then it must have some prime factor less than or equal to pn. But wait, that prime factor couldn't be any of the primes in the list because when you divided p1 * p2 * ... * pn by that prime, you would get a remainder of 1. So, that prime must be a new prime not in the original list. Therefore, there's a contradiction because Euclid assumed there were only finitely many primes. So, there must be infinitely many primes.\n\nBut I need to make sure I understand each step thoroughly.

So, we have P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 R, and we need to show that P \u2192 R.\n\nI think this is related to the transitive property of implications. I recall that if you have A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, then you can derive A \u2192 C. Is that right? So, applying that here, if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P should imply R. That seems to fit the problem.\n\nBut wait, is that always true? Let me think about it more carefully. Suppose P(x) is true for some x. Then by the first statement, Q(x) must also be true. And since Q(x) is true, by the second statement, R(x) must be true as well. So, starting from P(x), we can get to Q(x), and from there to R(x). Therefore, P(x) implies R(x). That makes sense.\n\nI think this is an application of the transitive law of inference. So, the transitive law allows us to chain implications together.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. First, I should probably recall what even and odd integers are. \n\nAn even integer is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer. So, if I have an even integer, I can denote it as 2k, where k is an integer. Similarly, an odd integer can be written as 2k + 1, right? So, let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let the even integer be 2k, where k is an integer.\n- Let the odd integer be 2m + 1, where m is an integer.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of these two integers. So, I'll add them together:\n\n2k + (2m + 1)\n\nLet me simplify this expression. First, distribute the addition:\n\n2k + 2m + 1\n\nHmm, I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n2(k + m) + 1\n\nSo now, the expression is 2(k + m) + 1. Now, since k and m are integers, their sum (k + m) is also an integer. Let me denote that as another integer, say n. So, n = k + m, which means:\n\n2n + 1\n\nNow, looking at this expression, 2n is clearly an even integer because it's 2 multiplied by an integer n. And then we have +1. Adding 1 to an even integer results in an odd integer. Therefore, 2n + 1 is an odd integer.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sum of an even integer (2k) and an odd integer (2m + 1) is 2(k + m) + 1, which is equal to 2",

Hmm, okay. Let me recall what Fibonacci sequence is. It's defined as F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones: F\u2099 = F\u2099\u208b\u2081 + F\u2099\u208b\u2082 for n > 2. \n\nFirst, induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.

F\u2083 is F\u2082 + F\u2081, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so F\u2083 - 1 is 2 - 1 = 1. Okay, that works. So the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step.

I need to show that it also holds for n = k + 1, so that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_k + F_{k+1} = F_{(k+1)+2} - 1, which simplifies to F_{k+3} - 1.\n\nStarting from the left side: F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_k + F_{k+1}.

Hmm, I remember something about prime factors and the well-ordering principle. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the well-ordering principle is.

This principle is often used in proofs by contradiction or induction.\n\nAlright, so I need to show that every positive integer can be written as a product of primes. I guess this means that every number can be broken down into prime factors, right? Like, for example, 6 is 2 times 3, which are both primes. Similarly, 8 is 2 times 2 times 2, so it's a product of primes. But how do I show this for any positive integer?\n\nMaybe I can use induction. Let's try that. The base case is n=1. Well, 1 is a bit tricky because it doesn't have any prime factors. But the statement says \"can be expressed as a product of prime numbers,\" and 1 can be considered as the product of zero primes.

A proper subset is a subset that does not include all the elements of the original set, right? So, if S has n elements, the total number of subsets would be 2^n, because each element can either be included or excluded, giving us 2 choices for each element.

Hmm, I remember that in set theory, the distributive property is one of those fundamental properties that certain operations distribute over others. But wait, is this one of those properties that hold for sets? Or do I need to verify it?\n\nLet me think. In algebra, we know that multiplication distributes over addition, but in set theory, the operations are union and intersection. So, is intersection distributive over union? I think it is, but I should probably go through it step by step to be sure.\n\nAlright, let me recall the definitions. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are in both sets, right? So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be all elements that are in A and also in either B or C. On the other hand, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) would be all elements that are in both A and B, or in both A and C.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start with the base case.\n\nFirst, let me test the statement for n = 1 because that's the smallest positive integer. Plugging in 1, we get 1\u00b3 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.

So, I can write that as:\n\nk\u00b3 - k = 6m, where m is some integer.\n\nNow, I need to show that if the statement is true for k, it must also be true for k + 2.

Applying that here:\n\n(k + 2)\u00b3 = k\u00b3 + 3k\u00b2(2) + 3k(2)\u00b2 + 2\u00b3\n= k\u00b3 + 6k\u00b2 + 12k + 8.\n\nSo, (k + 2)\u00b3 - (k + 2) = (k\u00b3 + 6k\u00b2 + 12k + 8) - k - 2",

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, let's recall what real numbers and rational numbers are. Real numbers include all numbers that can be represented on a number line, like integers, fractions, decimals, and so on. Rational numbers, on the other hand, are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero.

The problem says n \u2265 4, so I guess I should start with n = 4. Let me compute both 4! and 2^4. \n\nCalculating 4!: 4 factorial is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 24. Calculating 2^4 is 16.

Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, arguments are made up of premises and a conclusion. The premises are the statements that are given, and the conclusion is what we're trying to conclude. So here, the premises are \"If I go to the mall, I buy new shoes\" and \"I did not buy new shoes.\" The conclusion is \"I did not go to the mall.\"\n\nI think this is a conditional statement, so maybe I can use implications here. The first premise is an implication: If P, then Q. Where P is \"I go to the mall\" and Q is \"I buy new shoes.\" The second premise is the negation of Q, so not Q. So the conclusion is not P.\n\nWait, I remember something about contrapositive. The contrapositive of an implication is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it's logically equivalent to the original implication. So if the original is \"If P, then Q,\" the contrapositive would be \"If not Q, then not P.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent, that means if not Q is true, then not P must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the second premise is not Q, so according to the contrapositive, the conclusion not P should follow. That makes sense because if I didn't buy new shoes, then it logically follows that I didn't go to the mall. So the argument seems valid because it's an application of the contrapositive.\n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused between converse and inverse. The converse would be \"If I buy new shoes, I go to the mall,\" which isn't necessarily",

Adding n to that gives 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 + 2k + 1, which simplifies to 4k\u00b2 + 6k + 2. Factor out a 2, and we have 2(2k\u00b2 + 3k + 1). Again, that's even because it's 2",

Applying distributive law again, this becomes \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ \u2228 R.\n\nSo now, the left side is (P \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (P \u2227 R), and the right side is \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ \u2228 R. To show equivalence, I need to show that these two expressions are logically equivalent.

Hmm, induction seems a bit tricky for me, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what mathematical induction involves. From what I remember, it's a method where you prove a base case and then show that if it holds for an arbitrary case, it holds for the next one. That is, you prove it for n = 1, then assume it's true for some arbitrary n = k, and then prove it must also be true for n = k + 1.\n\nAlright, so let's start with the base case.

That makes sense intuitively, but maybe I should formalize it.\n\nFor the union part, A \u222a \u2205 = A. Let me recall the definition of union. The union of two sets A and B, A \u222a B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. So if B is the empty set, then there are no elements in B. Therefore, A \u222a \u2205 should just consist of all elements that are in A. Yeah, that seems straightforward.\n\nWhat about the intersection? The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in both A and B. If I take the intersection of A with the empty set, A \u2229 \u2205, there are no elements in the empty set, so there can't be any elements that are in both A and the empty set. Therefore, the intersection should be empty. That seems right.\n\nMaybe I can use the subset properties to formalize this. I remember that the empty set is a subset of every set. So, if I take any set A, the empty set is a subset, which means every element of \u2205 is also in A. But since \u2205 has no elements, it's trivially true. \n\nFor the union, since \u2205 is a subset of A, then A \u222a \u2205 must be A. Because when you take the union",

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in logic, proving equivalence usually involves showing that both sides have the same truth value in all possible scenarios.

Hmm, that sounds like it's related to the concept of prime factorization, right? I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are primes.\n\nThe statement says that every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes.

So, that seems to work for these examples.\n\nBut how do I prove this for any integer greater than 1? The problem suggests using strong induction, so let me recall what strong induction involves. Strong induction is a mathematical proof technique where we prove the base case, then assume it's true for all cases up to some n, and then prove it for n+1.

So, I need to check the truth table for both sides and see if they match. That sounds like a solid plan.\n\nLet me recall the truth table for implication. The implication P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q. So, maybe I can rewrite the original proposition in terms of disjunctions to simplify it.

I think there's a logical equivalence for that. If I have (A \u2228 B) \u2227 (A \u2228 ~B), what does that simplify to?\n\nWait, let me think. If A is true, then both (A \u2228 B) and (A \u2228 ~B) are true, so the conjunction is true. If A is false, then (A \u2228 B) is B and (A \u2228 ~B) is ~B.

Hmm, induction... right. I remember that mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. I think that means plugging in the smallest value of n and seeing if the formula holds true. The smallest positive integer is 1, so let me check when n=1. The sum of the first 1 positive integer is just 1. According to the formula, it should be 1*(1+1)/2, which is 2/2, which is 1. Okay, so that works. Good, the base case is satisfied.\n\nNow, the inductive step. That's where I assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to show that it works for k+1. So, let's say I assume that the sum of the first k positive integers is k(k+1)/2. That's my induction hypothesis. Now, I need to show that the sum of the first k+1 positive integers is (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nAlright, the sum of the first k+1 integers would be the sum of the first k integers plus the (k+1)th integer.

That means even numbers are like 2, 4, 6, -2, -4, and so on. On the other hand, an odd integer is any integer that isn't even, so they leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples are 1, 3, 5, -1, -3, etc.\n\nSo, the problem states that a + b is odd. I need to show that exactly one of a or b is odd. Let me consider the possible cases. Since there are only two possibilities for a and b\u2014either they are both even, both odd, or one even and one odd\u2014I can probably use these cases to analyze.\n\nFirst, let me think about what happens when you add two even numbers. If I take two even numbers, say 2 and 4, their sum is 6, which is even. Similarly, if I take negative even numbers, like -2 and -4, their sum is -6, which is still even. So, adding two even numbers gives an even result.\n\nNext, what happens when I add two odd numbers? Let me try 3 and 5. 3 + 5 is 8, which is even. Wait, that's even again. What about another pair, like 1 and 3? 1 + 3 is 4, also even. Hmm, so adding two odd numbers also gives an even result. That seems consistent.\n\nNow, what about adding an even and an odd number?

So, in logical terms, it's like: If n\u00b2 + 5 is even, then n is odd. So, I need to prove that.\n\nMaybe I can approach this by considering the parity of n. Parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. So, let's think about the possible cases for n: either n is even or n is odd. Then, I can see what happens to n\u00b2 + 5 in each case.\n\nCase 1: Suppose n is even. Then, n can be written as 2k for some integer k. So, n = 2k. Then, n squared would be (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2. So, n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2. Then, adding 5 to that, we get n\u00b2 + 5 = 4k\u00b2 + 5. Hmm, 4k\u00b2 is clearly even because it's 4 times some integer, so it",

Hmm, I need to figure out why n\u00b3 + 2n is always divisible by 3 no matter what positive integer n I plug in. Let me start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that when something is divisible by 3, it means that when you divide it by 3, there's no remainder. So, mathematically, n\u00b3 + 2n should be congruent to 0 modulo 3. In other words, n\u00b3 + 2n \u2261 0 mod 3. That feels like a good starting point.\n\nMaybe I can test this with some small numbers to see if it holds true. Let me try n = 1. Plugging in, 1\u00b3 + 2*1 = 1 + 2 = 3. 3 divided by 3 is 1, so yes, it's divisible by 3. Okay, that works.\n\nHow about n = 2? 2\u00b3 + 2*2 = 8 + 4 = 12. 12 divided by 3 is 4, so that's also divisible by 3. Good so far.\n\nLet me try n = 3. 3\u00b3 + 2*3 = 27 + 6 = 33. 33 divided by 3 is 11, so yes, still works.\n\nMaybe n = 4: 4\u00b3 + 2*4 = 64 + 8 = 72. 72 divided by 3 is 24. Yep, divisible by 3. Okay, seems consistent.\n\nWhat about a larger number, say n = 5: 125 + 10 = 135. 135 divided by 3 is 45. Also works.\n\nSo, from these examples, it seems like it's true.",
