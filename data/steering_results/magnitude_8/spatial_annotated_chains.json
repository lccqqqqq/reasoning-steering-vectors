How many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: A cube is painted red on all faces, then cut into 27 equal smaller cubes. How many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the original cube is painted on all its faces. That means the outer surfaces are all red. Then, it's cut into 27 smaller cubes. Since 27 is 3 cubed, that must mean the cube is divided into a 3x3x3 grid of smaller cubes. So, each edge of the original cube is split into three equal parts, right? That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these smaller cubes have exactly two red faces. I remember that when you paint a cube and then cut it into smaller cubes, the number of red faces each smaller cube has depends on its position in the larger cube. The cubes on the corners will have three red faces, the ones on the edges (but not corners) will have two red faces, and the ones on the faces (but not edges or corners) will have one red face. The cubes inside, completely surrounded by other cubes, won't have any red faces.\n\nSo, to find the cubes with exactly two red faces, I need to figure out how many such cubes are on the edges but not at the corners. Let's think about the edges of the original cube. Each edge has smaller cubes, and each edge of the original cube has 3 smaller cubes. But the two at the ends of each edge are the corner cubes, which have three red faces. So, the one in the middle of each edge must have exactly two red faces.\n\nNow, how many edges does a cube have? A cube has 12 edges. Each edge has 3 smaller cubes, but two of them are corners. So, each edge contributes one cube with exactly two red faces. Therefore, the number",

Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me imagine a square piece of paper. Let's say it's a standard square, so all sides are equal, and all angles are 90 degrees. Now, folding it in half vertically. If I do that, I'm bringing one side over to the other, right? So, if I have a square, and I fold it vertically, it's like making a crease down the middle from top to bottom. That should give me a rectangle, but actually, since it's folded in half, it's a rectangle with half the width but the same height.\n\nThen, the next step is folding it in half horizontally. So, now, after the first fold, the paper is a rectangle. Folding it horizontally would mean bringing one side over to the other horizontally, so that would create another crease, this time along the middle of the height. So, now, after both folds, the paper is a smaller square, right? Because it's half the width and half the height of the original square.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If the original is a square, when I fold it in half vertically, it's a rectangle with half the width. Then folding it horizontally would make it a smaller square? Hmm, actually, yes, because if you fold a rectangle in half horizontally, you're halving the height, so the resulting shape is a square again, but smaller.\n\nSo, after both folds, the paper is a smaller square, quarter the size of the original.

Hmm, okay. I think cross-sections are like the shapes you get when you slice through a 3D object with a plane, right? So, the area of that slice can vary depending on how you slice it. I need to figure out the maximum area possible.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a rectangular prism looks like. It's like a box, right? With length, width, and height as 3, 4, and 5 units. So, if I imagine it, it's a box that's 3 units long, 4 units wide, and 5 units tall.\n\nNow, when a plane cuts through a prism, the cross-section can be various shapes. The most common ones I can think of are triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, and hexagons, depending on how the plane intersects the edges of the prism. But since a rectangular prism only has 12 edges, the cross-section can't have more than six sides, I think. So, it's either a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, or hexagon.\n\nBut wait, for the maximum area, I probably don't want a cross-section with too many sides because each additional side might not necessarily add to the area. Maybe a triangle or a quadrilateral would give me the maximum area. Hmm.\n\nI remember that the largest cross-sectional area of a rectangular prism is actually the one that is formed by the face opposite to the longest face. So, in this case, the faces are 3\u00d74, 4\u00d75, and 3\u00d75. So, the largest face is 3\u00d75, which is 15. But wait, is that the maximum cross-sectional area?

When viewed from the front, the front view is a square. That suggests that the arrangement of the cubes must present a square face to the viewer. Similarly, the right view is also a square, so from the right side, it's another square. The top view, however, is a rectangle where the length is four times the width. So, the top view must be longer in one direction, probably along the length of the row.\n\nSince there are four cubes, they are arranged in a row, but the exact configuration isn't specified. The cubes are identical, so each cube must have the same size. Let me denote the side length of each cube as 's'. \n\nLet me consider the front view first. If the front view is a square, then the number of cubes visible from the front must form a square. Since it's a single row of four cubes, if they are arranged in a straight line, the front view would be a 1x4 rectangle, which is not a square. So that can't be it. Therefore, the cubes must be arranged in some 3D configuration where, when viewed from the front, they form a square.\n\nSimilarly, the right view is also a square.

Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know a cube has 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each edge is the same length, let's say each edge is 3 units long for simplicity. If I divide each edge into a 1:2 ratio, that means I'm looking at points that are 1 unit from one end and 2 units from the other. So, on each edge, the point that divides it in a 1:2 ratio is closer to the original corner.\n\nNow, the problem says to slice off each corner by cutting along planes that pass through these points.

What is the radius of the resulting circular cross-section?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a right circular cone. The cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. A plane cuts the cone parallel to the base at a height of 8 cm from the base. I need to find the radius of the circular cross-section created by this cut. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a plane cuts a cone parallel to the base, it creates a smaller, similar cone on top and a frustum below. But in this case, since the cut is 8 cm from the base, the smaller cone on top will have a height of 12 cm minus 8 cm, which is 4 cm. So the smaller cone has a height of 4 cm.\n\nNow, since the cones are similar, their dimensions are proportional. That means the ratio of the radius of the smaller cone to the base radius of the original cone should be the same as the ratio of their heights. So, if I let R be the radius of the smaller cone and r be the radius of the original cone, then R/r = h'/H, where h' is the height of the smaller cone and H is the height of the original cone.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, that would be R/5 = 4/12. Simplifying 4/12 gives 1/3, so R = 5*(1/3) = 5/3 cm. Therefore, the radius of the cross-section at 8 cm from the base is 5/3 cm. Wait, but hold on, is that the radius of the top of the frustum or the base of the smaller cone? Actually, when the plane cuts the cone, the cross-section is a circle with radius equal to the radius of the smaller cone, which is 5/3 cm.\n\nBut let me double-check that. So, the original cone has height 12",

The cube has a side length of 10 cm, and the hole has a radius of 2 cm. The hole is centered on a line connecting the centers of opposite faces. Hmm, let me visualize this.\n\nFirst, the cube has a volume. Since it's a cube, all sides are equal, so the volume should be side length cubed. That would be 10 cm times 10 cm times 10 cm, which is 1000 cubic centimeters. So, the original volume is 1000 cm\u00b3.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the volume of the hole that's been drilled out. The hole is a cylinder, right? Because when you drill a hole through a cube along a straight line, the cross-section is a circle, so the hole is cylindrical. So, the volume of the cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length) of the cylinder.\n\nGiven that the radius is 2 cm, so r = 2 cm. Now, the height of the cylinder would be the same as the length of the cube, right? Wait, not exactly. Because the hole is drilled through the cube, which is a 3D object, so the height of the cylinder would actually be the distance between the two opposite faces that the hole goes through. Since the cube is 10 cm on each side, the distance between the centers of two opposite faces is also 10 cm. So, the height of the cylinder is 10 cm.\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? Let me think. If the hole is drilled from one face to the opposite face, then yes, the length of the cylinder is indeed the same as the edge of the cube, which is 10 cm.

Since the base is equilateral, each of the three faces must have two sides of 8 cm, and the base side is 6 cm.\n\nWait, so each of the three triangular faces has two sides of 8 cm and one side of 6 cm.

What is the volume of the resulting solid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where a square with side length 6 is rotated around one of its diagonals, and I need to find the volume of the resulting solid. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. \n\nFirst, a square has four sides of equal length, and all angles are 90 degrees. If I rotate it around one of its diagonals, the diagonal will act as an axis of rotation. I think this will form some sort of three-dimensional shape, maybe like a cylinder or a cone? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me break it down.\n\nLet me start by recalling that the diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Since each side is 6 units, the diagonal \\( d \\) would be \\( \\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} \\). Calculating that, that's \\( \\sqrt{36 + 36} = \\sqrt{72} \\). Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{72} \\), that's \\( 6\\sqrt{2} \\). So, the length of the diagonal is \\( 6\\sqrt{2} \\) units.\n\nNow, when I rotate the square around this diagonal, what does that look like? I think it might create a three-dimensional figure where the square sweeps out a volume. Maybe it's a kind of double cone or something more complex. Let me try to imagine it.\n\nWait, actually, when you rotate a shape around an axis, it's often useful to use methods like the disk method or the shell method from calculus to find the volume. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can think about it in terms of simpler shapes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a shape called a \"double cone\" or a \"bicone.\" If I picture the square being rotated around its diagonal, the two triangles that make up the square will each form cones.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, probability is generally the ratio of the favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes.

So, I need to find the volume of this specific region and then divide it by the total volume.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total volume of the prism. That should be straightforward. The volume of a rectangular prism is length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height. Here, the dimensions are 2, 3, and 4. So, 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 24. Got that down.

I need to find the volume of the remaining solid after this cut. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I know that a cube has all sides equal and all angles right angles. When a corner is cut off by a plane, it's called a truncation, and the resulting cross-section is a polygon. In this case, the cross-section is an equilateral triangle. Since a cube has three dimensions, cutting off a corner with a plane can create different types of cross-sections depending on the angle and position of the plane.\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. So, the plane must intersect the cube in such a way that the three edges meeting at the corner are each cut at the same distance from the corner. That makes sense because if the triangle is equilateral, all the edges must be equal, which implies that the lengths from the corner to the points where the plane intersects the cube's edges are equal.\n\nLet me denote the cube with vertices labeled as usual. Let's say the cube has vertices at (0,0,0) to (10,10,10) in a 3D coordinate system. The corner being cut off is at (0,0,0), and the plane intersects the three edges along the x, y, and z-axes.

Let me try to visualize each step and figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says: 1) Fold in half along a diagonal. 2) Fold in half again along the other diagonal. 3) Cut off the pointed end with a straight cut perpendicular to the fold line. Then, when we unfold, what shape will the paper have?\n\nAlright, let me start by imagining a square piece of paper. Let's say it's a standard square, maybe 8.5x8.5 inches or something. Doesn't really matter the size, just the shape.\n\nStep 1: Fold in half along a diagonal. So, if I have a square, folding it along a diagonal would bring one corner to the opposite corner. So, after the first fold, the paper is a triangle, right? It's a right triangle with the right angle at the center where the fold is.\n\nStep 2: Fold in half again along the other diagonal. Wait, the other diagonal. Hmm, in a square, there are two diagonals: one from top-left to bottom-right and the other from top-right to bottom-left. So, if I've already folded along one diagonal, the second fold is along the other one. But hold on, if the paper is a triangle after the first fold, how do I fold it again along the other diagonal?\n\nLet me think. If I have a square, fold along one diagonal to make a triangle. Then, to fold along the other diagonal, I might need to fold it in a different way. Maybe not along the same axis. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps after the first fold, the paper is a triangle, and the second fold is along the other diagonal of that triangle.

Then, it's cut into 64 identical smaller cubes. I need to figure out how many of these smaller cubes have exactly two faces painted. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you cut a cube into smaller cubes, the number of smaller cubes is the cube of the original cube's side length. Since the original cube is cut into 64 smaller cubes, that means the original cube must have a side length of 4 because 4 cubed is 64. So, each edge of the original cube is 4 units long.\n\nNow, the original cube has each face painted a different color. So, each face is a different color, which means that when we cut it into smaller cubes, each small cube will have paint on its faces only if it's on the surface of the original cube. The small cubes inside, not on the surface, won't have any paint.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the number of small cubes with exactly two faces painted. Hmm, okay. So, these are the cubes that are on the edges of the original cube but not on the corners because the corners have three faces painted. So, I need to figure out how many such edge cubes there are.\n\nLet me visualize the cube. A cube has 12 edges, right? Each edge has a certain number of small cubes. Since each edge is 4 units long, that means each edge has 4 small cubes. But wait, the two at the ends of each edge are the corners, which we've already established have three painted faces. So, the cubes in between the corners on each edge would have exactly two painted faces.\n\nSo, for each edge, how many cubes have exactly two painted faces? It would be the total number of cubes on the edge minus the two corners. So, 4 minus 2 equals 2",

The base of the hemisphere and the base of the cone are the same, both with a radius of 5 cm. The height of the cone is 12 cm. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. It's like a cone with a hemisphere sitting on top of it, right? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says it's a hemisphere attached to the cone along their circular faces. So maybe it's a cone with a hemisphere attached to its base? Hmm, but the hemisphere could be attached on the side or the top. Hmm, maybe it's like a cone with a half-sphere glued to its base. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, but it's probably attached so that the flat face of the hemisphere is glued to the circular face of the cone. So, the base of the hemisphere is the same as the base of the cone. So, the radius is 5 cm for both, and the cone's height is 12 cm.\n\nAlright, so the solid is made up of two parts: a cone and a hemisphere. So, to find the total volume, I need to calculate the volume of the cone and the volume of the hemisphere and then add them together. That makes sense.\n\nFirst, I remember the formula for the volume of a cone. It's (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. In this case, the radius is 5 cm and the height is 12 cm. So, plugging those numbers in, the volume of the cone would be (1/3) * \u03c0 * (5)\u00b2 * 12.

The small cube is centered inside the large one, and their corresponding faces are parallel. The space between them is filled with water, and I need to find the volume of that water.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. The big cube is hollow, so it's like a shell, right? And the small cube is inside, perfectly centered. So, the space between them is kind of a hollow space where water can be placed. I think that means the water is filling the gap between the two cubes.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the volumes of both cubes. The volume of a cube is side length cubed, so for the large cube, that would be 8 cm times 8 cm times 8 cm. Let me calculate that: 8 \u00d7 8 is 64, and 64 \u00d7 8 is 512. So, the volume of the large cube is 512 cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, the small cube has a side length of 2 cm, so its volume is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2. That's 8 cubic centimeters. So, the small cube is much smaller than the large one.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the volume of water between them, not the volume of the small cube. So, is it just the volume of the large cube minus the volume of the small cube? That seems straightforward, but let me make sure.\n\nYes, because the space between them is the volume of the larger cube minus the volume of the smaller cube that's occupied by water.

The surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one face, so that's \\( 6a^2 \\).

It\u2019s got 12 pentagonal faces, right? The question is asking how many different planes of symmetry it has. Hmm, okay. I remember that symmetries in a shape include rotations and reflections, but here it's specifically about planes of symmetry, which I think are like lines where you can reflect the shape onto itself.\n\nFirst off, let me recall what a dodecahedron looks like. It's like a twelve-sided dice with pentagons instead of squares. Each face is a regular pentagon, and each vertex is where three pentagons meet. So, it's pretty symmetrical, which is why it's a Platonic solid.\n\nNow, symmetry planes. I think these are planes that cut through the center of the shape and divide it into mirror images. So, if I imagine holding a dodecahedron, the planes of symmetry would be like mirrors that pass through its center and some of its features.\n\nI remember that for regular polyhedrons, the number of symmetry planes corresponds to the number of ways you can slice the shape with a mirror and have both halves match perfectly. For example, a cube has several planes of symmetry: three through the centers of opposite faces, six through the midpoints of opposite edges, and four through the diagonals of opposite vertices. But a dodecahedron is more complex with pentagons.\n\nLet me think about the different types of symmetries. The regular dodecahedron has both rotational and reflectional symmetries, which together make up its full symmetry group. The order of the symmetry group for a regular dodecahedron is 60, which includes 12 rotations and 20 reflections, making 60 symmetries in total. But wait, is that right?

Hmm, let me visualize this. A triangular prism has two triangular bases connected by three rectangular faces. Each of these rectangular faces is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.\n\nFirst, I should probably draw a diagram to get a better understanding. Since it's a triangular prism, the bases are triangles, and the sides are rectangles. The bases are equilateral triangles with sides 4 cm. So each base is an equilateral triangle with sides 4 cm. The rectangular sides are 10 cm each. So, the height of the prism, which connects the two triangular bases, is 10 cm.\n\nWait, is the height of the prism 10 cm? Or is the length of the rectangular sides 10 cm? Hmm, yes, the problem says the rectangular sides have length 10 cm, so that must be the height of the prism. So, the distance between the two triangular bases is 10 cm.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the angle between any rectangular side and a triangular base. So, I think this angle is formed where the rectangular side meets the triangular base. Let me think about how to find this angle.\n\nI remember that in a prism, the angle between a rectangular face and the base can be found using the height of the prism and the side length of the base.

What is the total surface area of the prism?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find the total surface area of a regular hexagonal prism. Hmm, let me remember what a regular hexagonal prism is. It's a three-dimensional shape with two congruent regular hexagons as its bases connected by rectangular faces. Each side of the hexagon is equal in length, and the distance between the two bases is the height of the prism.\n\nThe problem gives me the side length of the hexagon as 5 cm and the height of the prism as 12 cm. So, I need to calculate the total surface area. Surface area usually includes both the area of the bases and the area of the sides.\n\nFirst, I think I should find the area of the two hexagonal bases. Since both bases are the same, I can calculate the area of one hexagon and then double it. To find the area of a regular hexagon, the formula is something like (3\u221a3 * side length squared)/2. Let me verify that. I recall that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the side length of the hexagon. So, the area of one equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/4) * side\u00b2. Therefore, six of them would be 6*(\u221a3/4)*side\u00b2, which simplifies to (3\u221a3/2)*side\u00b2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, plugging in the side length of 5 cm, the area of one hexagon is (3\u221a3/2)*(5)\u00b2. Calculating that: 5 squared is 25, so (3\u221a3/2)*25. Let me compute that: 3 times 25 is 75, so it's 75\u221a3/2. Since there are two bases, I need to multiply this by 2, so 75\u221a3/2 * 2 = 75\u221a3 cm\u00b2. That's the",

Each sphere touches the other two and the surface. I need to find the height of the center of the third sphere above the horizontal surface. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since all three spheres are identical and each touches the other two, they must form an equilateral triangle when viewed from above. The centers of the spheres should form an equilateral triangle as well. Each side of this triangle will be equal to twice the radius, right? Because each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, so the distance between any two centers should be 4 cm. Wait, no, hold on. If each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, the distance between centers is actually twice the radius, so 4 cm. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the centers form an equilateral triangle with sides of 4 cm. Now, I need to find the height of the center of the third sphere above the surface. That means I need to figure out the vertical distance from the surface to the top center of the highest sphere. Since all spheres are identical and each touches the surface, the bottom of each sphere is just touching the surface, so the height from the surface to the center of each sphere is equal to the radius, which is 2 cm. But wait, that's just the bottom sphere. The top sphere is higher because it's resting on the other two. So I need to find how much higher the center of the top sphere is above the surface.\n\nTo visualize this, I can imagine the three spheres forming a sort of triangular pyramid.

I need to find the area of the resulting triangular cross-section. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron looks like. It's a pyramid with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 4 cm. Now, the problem says the slicing plane passes through the midpoints of three edges that share a common vertex. So, let me think about that.\n\nLet me imagine the tetrahedron. Let's label the vertices as A, B, C, D. Let's say vertex A is the common vertex where the three edges meet. So, the midpoints of edges AB, AC, and AD will be the points where the slicing plane cuts through. Let me call these midpoints M, N, and P, respectively. So, M is the midpoint of AB, N is the midpoint of AC, and P is the midpoint of AD.\n\nNow, the cross-section created by slicing through M, N, and P will be a triangle, and I need to find the area of that triangle. To find the area, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height)/2, but I might need some more information about the triangle's dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can figure out the coordinates of these midpoints in a coordinate system and then compute the area using vectors or coordinate geometry.

The hole passes through the centers of two opposite faces and has an area of 4 cm\u00b2. Hmm, let me visualize this.\n\nFirst, the original cube has a side length of 6 cm, so its volume is 6 x 6 x 6, which is 216 cm\u00b3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the hole is a square that passes through the centers of two opposite faces.

Let me think about each one step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of these solids looks like. A truncated cube is like a cube that's been cut off at each corner, right? So, if you imagine taking a cube and chopping off each corner, you end up with a truncated cube. Similarly, a truncated octahedron is an octahedron that's been truncated. A rhombicuboctahedron is a polyhedron that's a bit more complex, and a snub dodecahedron is another one that's been snubbed, which I think means you're cutting off parts of it to create more faces.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out the number of edges each of these has.

Each sphere has a radius of 2 cm. I need to find the volume of the convex hull of the eight sphere centers. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the arrangement. If each sphere touches exactly three others, it must be some sort of regular structure where each sphere is in contact with three neighbors. Since it's cubic, I'm guessing it's a cube or something similar. But wait, a cube has eight vertices, which might correspond to the centers of the spheres. So maybe the centers form a cube?\n\nBut hold on, if the centers form a cube, each sphere would only touch three others if the cube is such that each center is connected to three others. Hmm, in a cube, each vertex is connected to three edges, so each center would be touching three others. That makes sense. So the centers are at the vertices of a cube.\n\nNow, if each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres should be twice the radius, right? So that would be 4 cm. Because each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, so the distance between centers is the sum of the radii, which is 2 + 2 = 4 cm.\n\nSo if the centers are at the vertices of a cube, and each edge of the cube is 4 cm, then the cube has edge length 4 cm. Therefore, the convex hull of the eight sphere centers is just a cube with edge length 4 cm.\n\nSo, to find the volume of this cube, I can use the formula for the volume of a cube, which is edge length cubed.

One corner of each cube meets at a point. So, it's like a 3D L-shape, right?\n\nFirst, maybe I should calculate the surface area of the entire solid because the wrapping paper needed is related to covering all the exposed surfaces. But wait, if I just add up the surface areas of the individual cubes, I might be double-counting some areas where they are glued together. So, I need to be careful with that.\n\nLet me start by finding the surface areas of each cube. The formula for the surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of its edge length. So, for the 3 cm cube, that's 6*(3^2) = 6*9 = 54 cm\u00b2. For the 4 cm cube, it's 6*(4^2) = 6*16 = 96 cm\u00b2. And for the 5 cm cube, it's 6*(5^2) = 6*25 = 150 cm\u00b2. Adding those up, 54 + 96 + 150 equals 300 cm\u00b2. So, the total surface area is 300 cm\u00b2.\n\nBut when the cubes are put together to form an L-shape, some faces are hidden where they are glued together.

Each prism has a side length of 2 cm and a height of 8 cm. Their axes are perpendicular, and they pass through each other's centers. I need to find the volume of their intersection. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the prisms. A regular hexagonal prism has two hexagonal bases connected by rectangular faces. Since the side length is 2 cm, each side of the hexagon is 2 cm. The height of the prism is 8 cm, which is the distance between the two hexagonal bases. So, each prism is 8 cm tall.\n\nNow, the prisms intersect each other, and their axes are perpendicular. I think that means one prism is standing vertically, and the other is rotated 90 degrees relative to it. Since their axes pass through each other's centers, the centers of the two prisms coincide. So, the intersection should be symmetrical in some way.\n\nI need to find the volume of this intersection. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as the region where both prisms overlap. Since both prisms have the same dimensions, the intersection might have some symmetry, and perhaps I can calculate it using some geometric formulas.\n\nLet me recall that the volume of a prism is the area of the base times the height. So, the volume of one prism is (Area of hexagon) \u00d7 height. Let me compute that. The area of a regular hexagon with side length 'a' is given by the formula (3\u221a3 / 2) * a\u00b2. So, plugging in a = 2 cm, the area is (3\u221a3 / 2) * 4 = 6\u221a3 cm\u00b2. Then, the volume of one prism is 6\u221a3 cm\u00b2 \u00d7 8 cm = 48",

It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases. Now, since it's inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the surface of the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 4 cm, so the distance from the center of the sphere to any vertex of the octahedron is 4 cm.\n\nI remember that for regular polyhedrons, there's a relationship between their edge length and the radius of the circumscribed sphere.

If I take a cross-section through the octahedron along a plane that passes through two opposite vertices and the center, I should see a regular hexagon.

The options are a regular hexagon, an equilateral triangle, a regular pentagon, and a rhombus. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out which one isn't possible. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a projection of a cube is essentially what you get when you project the cube onto a flat surface, right? So, depending on how you angle the cube relative to the light source (or the camera), the shadow or image you see can change. The key here is understanding the possible shapes that can result from these projections.\n\nLet me recall what each of these shapes looks like and how they might be formed from a cube.\n\nStarting with option A: a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles, each 120 degrees. I remember that if you project a cube onto a plane at a certain angle, you can get a hexagon. Specifically, if you project along a space diagonal, the shadow cast by the cube can indeed form a regular hexagon. So, A is possible.\n\nMoving on to option B: an equilateral triangle. Hmm, an equilateral triangle has three equal sides and 60-degree angles. Now, can a cube's projection result in an equilateral triangle? I'm not so sure. Let me visualize this. If I try to think of projecting a cube onto a plane, the shadow typically has four sides if the projection is along one of the principal axes, like the top view or front view.

So, each face is a triangle, and each center would be the centroid or the center of mass of that triangle. If I connect these centers, what does that form look like? I need to figure out what polyhedron this resulting figure is.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of an icosahedron. It's dual to the dodecahedron, which has 12 faces and 20 vertices. The dual of a polyhedron is formed by connecting the centers of the original's faces. So, does that mean connecting the centers of the faces of an icosahedron would give me its dual, the dodecahedron? Wait, but hold on, isn't the dual of an icosahedron a dodecahedron? Yes, that's correct. But the question is about connecting the centers of adjacent faces. So, is that exactly the dual? Or is it something else?\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The dual polyhedron is constructed by placing a vertex at the center of each face of the original polyhedron and connecting these vertices with edges if the original faces were adjacent.

I need to find the total surface area of the cube. Hmm, let me think. I remember that cubes have all sides equal, and there are some properties related to their diagonals. Maybe I can figure out the side length first and then use that to find the surface area.\n\nFirst, what do I know about the diagonal of a cube? I recall that in a cube, the space diagonal (the diagonal that goes from one corner to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the cube) can be calculated using the formula. I think it's related to the side length. Let me try to recall the formula.\n\nIf the side length of the cube is 's', then the space diagonal 'd' is given by:\n\nd = s\u221a3\n\nWait, is that right? Let me visualize a cube. Each edge is 's', and the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with two edges and the face diagonal. So, the face diagonal would be s\u221a2, right? Then, the space diagonal is the hypotenuse of another right triangle where the other two sides are the face diagonal and the edge. So, actually, the space diagonal should be sqrt[(s\u221a2)^2 + s^2] = sqrt(2s\u00b2 + s\u00b2) = sqrt(3s\u00b2) = s\u221a3. Okay, so my initial thought was correct. So, d = s\u221a3.\n\nGiven that the diagonal is 6\u221a3 cm, so I can set up the equation:\n\ns\u221a3 = 6\u221a3\n\nHmm, so if I divide both sides by \u221a3, I get:\n\ns = 6 cm\n\nAlright, so the side length is 6 cm.

I remember that for regular polyhedrons, there are formulas to calculate their circumradius, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula for a tetrahedron. Let me think.\n\nFirst, what is a regular tetrahedron? It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 6 cm in this case. Now, the sphere that passes through all four vertices is called the circumscribed sphere or the circumphere. The radius of this sphere is the circumradius.\n\nI think the formula for the circumradius \\( R \\) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length \\( a \\) is something like \\( R = \\frac{a \\sqrt{6}}{4} \\). Wait, is that right? Let me recall. Maybe I should derive it to be sure.\n\nI remember that in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, and all the faces are equilateral triangles. So, the center of the circumscribed sphere should be equidistant from all four vertices. That point is called the centroid or the circumcenter of the tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the circumradius, I can use some coordinate geometry. Maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that the centroid is at the origin, and then find the distance from the centroid to any vertex, which would be the circumradius.\n\nLet me try that approach.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know a regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. Each internal angle in a regular hexagon is 120 degrees because the formula for internal angles is \\((n-2)*180/n\\) where n=6, so that's 720/6=120 degrees each. Now, when they say it's folded to form a 3D shape where opposite vertices meet, I need to visualize how that would happen.\n\nI think about what happens when you fold a flat shape into 3D. It's like origami, right? So folding the hexagon along certain lines to bring opposite vertices together. Opposite vertices in a hexagon are three apart. So, in a regular hexagon, each vertex has one opposite vertex directly across from it.\n\nIf I label the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in order, then A is opposite to D, B opposite to E, and C opposite to F. So, when they say opposite vertices meet, it might mean that vertex A is folded onto vertex D, B onto E, and C onto F.\n\nBut how does folding a hexagon into 3D work? I remember that when you fold a polygon, you create creases or edges where the folding happens. So, to bring A to D, I might need to fold along the lines connecting midpoints or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe it's like making a net of a 3D shape.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but let me try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you rotate a shape around a line, it creates a three-dimensional solid. In this case, it's an equilateral triangle being rotated around one of its sides. So, I need to figure out what kind of solid that would form. Since it's a triangle and we're rotating it around one of its sides, I think it's going to form a cone or something similar. But wait, an equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so when you rotate it around one side, the opposite vertex will trace a circle, right? That makes me think it's a cone. But is it just a regular cone, or is there more to it?\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have an equilateral triangle with side length 4, and I spin it around one of its sides, the side it's being rotated around is fixed, and the opposite vertex moves in a circular path. So, the height of the triangle from that vertex to the base (the side we're rotating around) should be the radius of the base of the cone. Is that correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. So, if I have triangle ABC with side AB as the base, and I'm rotating around AB, then point C is the vertex opposite AB. The height from point C to AB will be the radius of the circle that point C traces when rotated. So, that height is the radius of the base of the cone.\n\nBut what is the height of the triangle?

The cone has the minimum possible volume. I need to find the ratio of the height of the cone to the radius of its base. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. There's a cone, and inside it, snugly fit, is a sphere with radius 5. The cone has the smallest possible volume for such a setup. I need to figure out the ratio of the cone's height to its base radius.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling some geometry concepts. A right circular cone has a circular base and a height perpendicular to the base from the apex. A sphere inscribed in the cone would touch the cone along a circle, right? The sphere is tangent to the cone's lateral surface and also tangent to the base of the cone. So, the sphere is perfectly fitted inside the cone.\n\nI think the first step is to draw a cross-sectional view of the cone and the inscribed sphere.

The sphere will touch the base of the cone and the two sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me denote the radius of the cone's base as r and its height as h. The sphere has radius 5, so its diameter is 10. Since the sphere is inscribed in the cone, the diameter of the sphere can't be larger than the height of the cone, right? So, h must be at least 10. But we need to find the minimum volume cone, so h might be exactly 10 or something else? Wait, no, because the sphere is inscribed, not just sitting at the bottom.

The original cube has an edge length of 4, and I need to find the surface area of the resulting cuboctahedron. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. \n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a cuboctahedron looks like. From what I remember, a cuboctahedron is a polyhedron that has 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. It's like a cube that's had its corners cut off, right? So, truncating each corner of the cube. That makes sense. \n\nThe problem says that each corner is cut to the midpoints of the adjacent edges. So, if the original cube has an edge length of 4, then each edge is 4 units long. When we cut off a corner, we're essentially slicing it at the midpoint of each edge that meets at that corner. Since a cube has 12 edges, and each corner is where three edges meet, but each truncation affects three edges. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out how much is being cut off.\n\nWait, if we cut at the midpoints, that means each original edge of the cube will be divided into two equal parts. So, each original edge is 4 units, so cutting at 2 units from each end. That would mean each original edge is now split into two segments of 2 units each. But how does that affect the resulting edges of the cuboctahedron?\n\nEach corner truncation replaces a corner with a new face. Since we're cutting at the midpoints, the new face added at each corner is a triangle. So, each corner that's cut off adds a triangular face.

It's placed with one corner at the origin and its sides along the coordinate axes. I need to find the distance from the origin to the farthest point on the box. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rectangular box has all its corners defined by coordinates in 3D space. Since one corner is at the origin (0,0,0), the opposite corner would be at (2,3,4), right? Because the dimensions are 2, 3, and 4, so the opposite corner would have those coordinates.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the farthest point from the origin on the surface of this box.

Maybe I should calculate the distance from the origin to each of the box's vertices and see which one is the largest.\n\nWait, but is the opposite corner actually the farthest point? I think it is because in a rectangular box, the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two corners. So, the space diagonal from the origin to the opposite corner should be the farthest point.

A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape where all four faces are equilateral triangles, and all edges are of equal length. So, I need to figure out the edge length of this tetrahedron, and then calculate its volume.\n\nEach sphere has a radius of 2 cm, and since each sphere touches three others, the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres should be twice the radius, right?

So, the edge length of the tetrahedron is 4 cm.\n\nWait, let me make sure. If two spheres each with radius r touch each other, the distance between their centers is indeed 2r. So, yeah, 2*2=4 cm.

Now, when they say each corner is being cut off, that sounds like we're performing a truncation on the cube. Truncation typically means cutting off the corners, turning each corner into a new face.

But wait, I remember that when you truncate a cube, each original face gets transformed into a new shape. Since we're cutting off each corner, the original square faces will become octagons or something else? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, each corner cut is a small portion of the original edge. The problem says the cut is made 2 cm from each corner along each edge. So, each edge is 10 cm long, and we're cutting off 2 cm from each end.

Since the plane is cutting through the cylinder and is parallel to the axis, the cross-section should be a circle, right? But wait, hold on. If the plane passes through the center, does that mean it's cutting through the center of the cylinder's height? So, it's not just any plane, but one that goes through the central axis? Or is it cutting through the center of the circular base?\n\nWait, the problem says the plane is parallel to the axis. So, if it's parallel to the axis, and passes through the center, maybe it's creating a cross-section that's a circle? Or is it an ellipse? Hmm, no, wait. If the plane is parallel to the axis, then the cross-section should be a rectangle, because the plane is cutting along the length of the cylinder, right? But if it passes through the center, then it's cutting through the center of the circular base. Hmm, I might be confusing something here.\n\nWait, let's clarify.

I need to find the volume of the resulting 3D solid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you rotate a shape around a side, it creates a three-dimensional object. In this case, a regular pentagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. So, if I rotate it around one of its sides, the resulting solid will have some kind of symmetry around that side.\n\nI remember that when you rotate a polygon around one of its sides, the shape formed is called a \"solid of revolution.\" For example, rotating a rectangle around one of its sides gives you a cylinder, and rotating a triangle around one of its sides gives you a cone.

Alternatively, it could be a combination of cones or something else. Maybe it's a type of prism or a pyramid? Hmm, actually, no. When you rotate a polygon around a side, each vertex not on the axis of rotation will trace out a circle. So, each vertex will create a circle, and the space between them will create a kind of curved shape.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I have a regular pentagon and I spin it around one of its sides, each of the other four vertices will trace out a circle with a radius equal to the distance from that vertex to the axis of rotation (the side around which it's being rotated).

If I label the square ABCD, with AB, BC, CD, DA as the sides, and let's say the axis of rotation passes through the midpoints of AB and CD.

If the axis passes through the midpoints of two opposite sides, which would be the midpoints of AB and CD. The midpoint of AB is (1,0) and the midpoint of CD is (1,2). So, the axis is a vertical line at x = 1.\n\nSo, when I rotate the square around this vertical line, what does the solid look like? Hmm, rotating a square around an axis that's perpendicular to one of its sides. Wait, is the axis perpendicular? If the axis is through the midpoints of AB and CD, which are both on the vertical sides, so yes, the axis is vertical.\n\nSo, when I rotate the square around this vertical axis, each point on the square will trace a circle around the axis.

A) Regular hexagon B) Square C) Equilateral triangle D) Regular pentagon.\" Hmm, interesting. I remember that cross-sections of a cube can create different shapes depending on how you slice it. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a cross-section is. If I take a cube and make a straight cut through it, the intersection of the cutting plane with the cube's faces will form a cross-section. Depending on the angle and position of the cut, I can get different polygons. I know that a cube has six square faces, twelve edges, and eight vertices. So, the cross-section can't be just any polygon; it depends on how the plane intersects the cube.\n\nLet me start by considering each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Regular hexagon. Hmm, can a cross-section of a cube be a regular hexagon? I think so. I remember that if you slice a cube at an angle that's not too steep and pass through the midpoints of six edges, you can get a regular hexagonal cross-section. Each side of the hexagon would be equal because each edge of the cube is the same length, and the angles would all be 120 degrees since each face of the cube is a square. So, yes, a regular hexagon is possible.\n\nOption B: Square. Well, that's straightforward. If I make a straight cut parallel to one of the faces of the cube, the cross-section is a square, same as the face itself. So, definitely, a square is obtainable.\n\nOption C: Equilateral triangle. Hmm, can a cross-section be an equilateral triangle? Let me visualize this. An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles 60 degrees. How would I get that from a cube?

A plane is cutting through it, parallel to one face and passing through the midpoints of the three edges meeting at the opposite vertex. I need to find the area of the resulting triangular cross-section.\n\nFirst, let me visualize a regular tetrahedron. It's a pyramid with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 4 cm. Now, the problem says that a plane is cutting through the tetrahedron, and this plane is parallel to one of the faces. It also passes through the midpoints of the three edges that meet at the opposite vertex. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, let me try to imagine or maybe sketch this mentally. If the tetrahedron is sitting on one face, the plane is cutting through the midpoints of the edges opposite to that base. Since the plane is parallel to the base, the cross-section should also be a triangle similar to the base. That makes sense because when a plane cuts a tetrahedron parallel to a face, the resulting cross-section is similar to that face.\n\nNow, since the plane passes through the midpoints of the edges, the cross-section triangle should be similar but scaled down. The question is, by how much? I need to figure out the scaling factor to find the side length of the cross-section triangle, which will allow me to compute its area.\n\nLet me recall that in similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear measurements. So, if I can find the ratio of the heights of the two triangles, I can square that ratio to get the area ratio.\n\nBut first, what is the height of the original tetrahedron?

I need to find the volume of the convex hull of the centers of these six spheres. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this setup.\n\nFirst off, if each sphere touches exactly four others, this must be some kind of regular structure. I remember that in 3D space, the most symmetrical arrangement where each sphere is tangent to four others is probably a tetrahedral arrangement, but wait, a tetrahedron has four faces, so maybe not. Or is it a cube? No, in a cube, each sphere would be touching more than four others, right? Wait, in a cube, each sphere would be touching three others if it's a simple cubic packing. Hmm, maybe it's a different polyhedron.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe it's an octahedral arrangement. An octahedron has eight faces, and each vertex is where four edges meet. So, if each sphere is at a vertex of an octahedron, each sphere would touch four others. That seems right because each vertex in a regular octahedron is connected to four edges. So, yes, six spheres arranged at the vertices of a regular octahedron, each touching four others.\n\nSo, the centers of the six spheres form a regular octahedron. Now, I need to find the volume of the convex hull of these centers. Since it's a convex hull, it's essentially the shape formed by connecting all the points (centers of the spheres), which in this case is just the regular octahedron itself.

It's created by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the circle has a radius of 3 cm, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 7 cm. I think this distance is called the major radius, and the radius of the circle itself is the minor radius.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if the circle is being rotated around an axis that's 7 cm away from its center, that should form a torus. The circle has a radius of 3 cm, so that must be the minor radius. I think the major radius is the distance from the center of the circle to the center of the torus. So, major radius R is 7 cm, and minor radius r is 3 cm.\n\nI recall that the volume of a torus can be calculated using a specific formula. Let me try to remember it. I think it's something like 2\u03c0 squared times the minor radius times the major radius squared, right? Or maybe it's 2\u03c0 multiplied by something else. Wait, I should look it up in my notes or maybe derive it.\n\nOh, wait, I think it's the area of the circle (which is \u03c0r\u00b2) multiplied by the distance traveled by the center of the circle during the rotation. Since it's a full rotation, that distance would be the circumference of the circular path. The circumference is 2\u03c0R, where R is the major radius. So, putting that together, the volume should be (\u03c0r\u00b2) * (2\u03c0R). So, it's 2\u03c0\u00b2Rr\u00b2.

The base has a side length of 4 cm, and the pyramid's height is 8 cm. I need to find the total surface area. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the total surface area of a pyramid is the sum of the base area and the lateral surface area. The base is a regular hexagon, so that part I can calculate. The lateral surface area is a bit trickier because it involves finding the area of the triangular faces. Since all the triangular faces are identical, I can find the area of one and multiply it by six.\n\nStarting with the base area. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the side length of the hexagon, which is 4 cm. The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula: \n\nArea = (\u221a3 / 4) * side\u00b2\n\nSo, plugging in 4 cm for the side length:\n\nBase Area = 6 * (\u221a3 / 4) * (4)\u00b2\n\nLet me compute that. First, 4 squared is 16. Then, 16 times \u221a3 divided by 4 is 4\u221a3. Multiply that by 6:\n\n6 * 4\u221a3 = 24\u221a3 cm\u00b2\n\nOkay, so the base area is 24\u221a3 cm\u00b2.\n\nNow, onto the lateral surface area. Each of the triangular faces is congruent, so I can find the area of one and multiply by six. But wait, what's the height of each triangular face?

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out how many unit cubes are visible from one corner or something like that. Let me think.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you look at a cube from a corner, you can see three faces of the cube. So, in a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube, each face has 25 unit cubes. But if I just add three faces together, that would be 75. But wait, that can't be right because there's an overlap along the edges where the faces meet.

I think it's not the entire edge, but just the edge cubes that are along the line of sight. Wait, no, actually, from a corner viewpoint, you can see three faces, but along each face, the cubes that are along the main diagonal are the ones that are shared between two faces. So, maybe I need to subtract those?\n\nLet me recall. If I have three faces, each with 25 cubes, the total would be 75. But the cubes along the edges where the faces meet are counted twice, right? Each edge has 5 cubes, but in the three faces, each edge is counted once for each face it belongs to. So, each edge is shared by two faces, so we have three edges meeting at the corner. So, each edge has 5 cubes, but in the total count of 75, each edge is counted twice.

A) Cube B) Icosahedron C) Tetrahedron D) Octahedron<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which Platonic solid is dual to a regular dodecahedron. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a regular dodecahedron is. I know it's one of the Platonic solids, which means it's a regular, convex polyhedron with all faces being congruent regular polygons and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Specifically, a regular dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon. So, it's like a 12-sided figure with all sides and angles equal.\n\nNow, the question is about its dual. Dual polyhedrons, as far as I remember, are related through a process called dualization. In dual polyhedrons, the vertices of one correspond to the faces of the other, and the faces of one correspond to the vertices of the other. So, if I can figure out how the faces and vertices relate, I can find the dual.\n\nA regular dodecahedron has 12 faces. Each face is a pentagon, and each pentagon has 5 edges and 5 vertices. But wait, in polyhedrons, each edge is shared by two faces. So, the total number of edges can be calculated. For a dodecahedron, the formula for the number of edges is (12 faces * 5 edges per face) / 2 = 30 edges. So, it has 30 edges.\n\nNow, since it's dual, the dual polyhedron will have a number of faces equal to the number of vertices of the original. The dodecahedron has how many vertices? Let me recall, for a regular dodecahedron, each vertex is where 3 faces meet because each vertex is where three pentagons meet. So, the number of vertices can be calculated by considering the total number of edges and the fact that each vertex is shared by 3",

It says the base is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 4 cm, and the height of the prism is 10 cm. I need to find the total length of all the edges. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a prism has two congruent bases connected by rectangles. Since it's a triangular prism, the bases are triangles. The base is an equilateral triangle, so all three sides are equal, each 4 cm. Now, I need to figure out all the edges. \n\nLet me visualize this. An equilateral triangle has three sides, so the base has three edges, each 4 cm. Then, for the prism, there are three more edges that connect the corresponding vertices of the two bases. These are called the lateral edges. Since the height of the prism is 10 cm, that should be the length of these lateral edges, right? So each of these edges is 10 cm.\n\nSo, let me count how many edges there are in total. Each base has three edges, so two bases have 3 times 2, which is 6 edges. Then, the lateral edges are three in number, each 10 cm. So, in total, that's 6 + 3 edges. \n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in a prism, there are two triangular bases, each with three edges, so that's 6 edges, and then three lateral edges connecting corresponding vertices. So, 6 + 3 = 9 edges in total.

The base is a circle with radius 4 cm, and the height from the base to the tip is 3 cm. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a cone, the slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the radius and height are perpendicular to each other, the slant height (let me call it 'l') should be the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the other two sides are the radius and the height. So, l = sqrt(r\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Plugging in the numbers, r is 4 cm and h is 3 cm. That gives l = sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5 cm.

The axis of the hole passes through the center of the sphere, and the hole itself has a radius of 3 cm. I need to find the surface area of the remaining solid, including the inner surface of the hole. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a solid object with a hole drilled through it, the surface area changes. The original sphere has a certain surface area, but when you cut out the hole, you remove some material, but you also create a new inner surface where the hole is. So, I guess I need to calculate both the remaining outer surface area and add the inner surface area of the hole.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the surface area of a sphere. It's 4\u03c0r\u00b2, right? So for a sphere with radius 5 cm, the surface area would be 4\u03c0*(5)^2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, when we cut out the hole, we're removing a smaller sphere from the original one. The hole has a radius of 3 cm, so the sphere that's removed is a smaller sphere with radius 3 cm. But wait, is that correct? Because when you drill a hole through a sphere, you're not just removing a smaller sphere; it's more like a cylindrical hole with hemispherical ends. Hmm, actually, maybe I was wrong there. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, in this case, the problem says the axis passes through the center, and the hole is circular.

The frustum has a lower base radius of 8 cm, an upper base radius of 3 cm, and a slant height of 13 cm. I need to find the height of the frustum. Hmm, frustums can be a bit tricky, but let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that a frustum is like a cone with the top cut off by a plane parallel to the base. So, the frustum has two circular bases, one larger (the lower base) and one smaller (the upper base). The radii of these bases are given: 8 cm for the lower and 3 cm for the upper. The slant height, which is the distance along the lateral side from one base to the other, is 13 cm.\n\nI also recall that in problems involving cones, similar triangles often come into play because the original cone and the smaller cone that was cut off are similar. Maybe I can use similar triangles to find the height of the frustum.\n\nLet me visualize the frustum. If I imagine the original cone before it was cut, it would have a base radius of 8 cm, and the smaller cone that was removed would have a base radius of 3 cm. The height of the original cone would then be the height of the frustum plus the height of the smaller cone that was cut off.\n\nLet me denote the height of the frustum as h. So, the height of the original cone would be h + something, and the height of the smaller cone would be just the difference. Hmm, maybe I should use variables to represent these.\n\nLet me denote:\n- R = radius of the lower base = 8 cm\n- r = radius of the upper base = 3 cm\n- l = slant height = 13 cm\n- H = height of the frustum (what I need to find)\n- h",

Also, I think the height of a regular tetrahedron from one vertex to the base can be calculated using some geometric formulas.\n\nWait, actually, I think the height of a regular tetrahedron is the perpendicular distance from one vertex to the opposite face.

A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. Each face is labeled with a number from 1 to 6. Now, the key information here is that opposite faces sum to 7.

Similarly, if a face is labeled 2, the opposite face should be 5, and if it's labeled 3, the opposite face should be 4.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the face opposite to the one labeled 3. Since 3 and its opposite face add up to 7, the opposite face must be 7 - 3, which is 4.

The large cube is painted red on all its faces, and then it's disassembled. I need to figure out how many unit cubes have exactly one red face. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you paint all the faces of a cube and then take it apart, the unit cubes (or smaller cubes) that end up with paint on their faces depend on their positions in the larger cube. Specifically, the cubes on the corners will have three painted faces, the ones on the edges (but not corners) will have two painted faces, and the ones on the faces (but not edges or corners) will have one painted face. The ones inside the cube, not on any face, won't have any paint.\n\nSo, the question is asking about the unit cubes with exactly one red face. That means I need to figure out how many such cubes there are. Let me visualize the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. It's like a Rubik's cube, right? So, it has 3 layers in each direction: length, width, and height.\n\nI think the first step is to figure out how many unit cubes are on each face of the larger cube. Each face of a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube has 9 unit cubes, right? Since 3\u00d73 is 9. Now, since a cube has 6 faces, that would be 6\u00d79 = 54 unit cubes painted. But wait, that's not the question.

I need to find the area of the cross-section formed when the cube is cut by a plane that passes through two diagonally opposite vertices and the midpoint of an edge that doesn't contain either of these vertices. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the cube in my mind. A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and all edges are equal. Each face is a square, and each edge is 4 cm long. Now, the plane is passing through two diagonally opposite vertices. So, in a cube, the space diagonal connects two vertices that are not on the same face. For example, if I imagine the cube sitting on a table, one vertex is at the bottom front left, and the diagonally opposite one would be at the top back right. \n\nNow, the plane also passes through the midpoint of an edge that doesn't contain either of these two diagonal vertices. Hmm, so the edge in question is somewhere else on the cube, not connected to either of these two opposite corners.

Let's place the cube in a 3D coordinate system where one corner is at the origin (0,0,0), and the opposite corner is at (4,4,4). So, the two diagonally opposite vertices would be (0,0,0) and (4,4,4).

I have a rectangle, 8 cm in height and 12 cm in length. When I fold it so that one corner touches the opposite corner, it's like bringing corner A to corner C, maybe? Let me label the rectangle with coordinates to make it easier. Let's say the rectangle is placed with one corner at the origin (0,0), so the corners are at (0,0), (12,0), (12,8), and (0,8). If I fold corner (0,0) to touch corner (12,8), the fold line will be the crease that connects these two points. Wait, no, the fold is actually the line along which the paper is folded so that the corner touches the opposite corner.\n\nSo, when you fold a paper, the crease (fold line) is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the two corners being folded.

Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch a cylinder in my mind. It has two circular bases, one on top and one at the bottom. The radius is 5 cm, so each base is a circle with radius 5 cm. The height is 12 cm, meaning the distance between the two bases is 12 cm. Now, the plane is cutting through a diameter of the top base. So, if I imagine looking down at the top of the cylinder, the plane is slicing through the center, right? That means it's creating a straight line across the top circle, passing through the center.\n\nBut it's also tangent to the bottom base. Tangent means it just touches the bottom base at a single point. So, the plane is cutting through the top diameter and touching the bottom base at one point. I think this creates a kind of slant cut through the cylinder, forming a slanted surface.\n\nI need to find the volume of the larger piece. So, the cylinder is being split into two parts, and one part is larger than the other. I need to figure out which one is larger and calculate its volume.\n\nLet me think about the cross-sectional area first.

Because if two spheres touch each other, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Since all radii are the same here, it should just be 3 cm times 2, which is 6 cm. But hold on, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm oversimplifying.\n\nLet me think again. If each sphere touches three others, it's not just a simple tetrahedron.

The radius of the circular base is 5 cm, and the height of the cylinder is 8 cm. Hmm, let me try to visualize this. It's like a cylinder with a hemisphere on top or maybe on the side? Wait, it says the hemisphere is attached along the circular base. So, the circular base of the hemisphere is connected to the top circular face of the cylinder? Or is it the bottom? Hmm, well, maybe it doesn't really matter because the surface area would include both the curved parts and the circular parts.\n\nAlright, so let me recall the formulas for the surface areas of a cylinder and a hemisphere. For a cylinder, the total surface area is the sum of the lateral surface area and the areas of the two circular bases. The lateral surface area is 2\u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the height. The two circular bases would each have an area of \u03c0r\u00b2, so together that's 2\u03c0r\u00b2.

The curved surface area is (2\u03c0r\u00b2)/3, and the base is \u03c0r\u00b2. But in this case, the hemisphere is attached to the cylinder along its base, so that base is no longer an exposed face.

The cube is being sliced by the plane x + y + z = 2. I need to find the area of the cross-section created by this slice.\n\nHmm, okay, cross-sections of cubes by planes can create different shapes depending on how the plane cuts through the cube. Since the cube is a unit cube, all edges are 1 unit long. The plane given is x + y + z = 2. That plane is a bit tricky because it's not aligned with the coordinate axes, so it's going to intersect the cube in a polygonal shape.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out where the plane intersects the edges of the cube.

The corners are being cut off by planes that pass through points which divide each edge in a 1:3 ratio, starting from each vertex. The question is asking how many faces the resulting solid will have.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each edge is 4 cm long. If we cut off each corner, which is a vertex, with a plane, the corner is replaced by a new face. So, each original vertex becomes a new face. Since there are 8 vertices, I might think that we're adding 8 new faces. But I also need to consider how this affects the original faces.\n\nEach original face of the cube is a square. When we cut off a corner, the plane intersects the edges meeting at that corner. Since each edge is divided in a 1:3 ratio, the point where the plane cuts the edge is 1 cm from the vertex and 3 cm from the other end. So, each original edge will have a cut 1 cm from each end, effectively dividing each edge into three segments: 1 cm, 2 cm, and 1 cm.\n\nWait, no. If it's a 1:3 ratio from each vertex, then each edge is divided into two parts: one part is 1 cm, and the other is 3 cm. So, from each vertex, along each edge, we go 1 cm towards the center, and the rest is 3 cm. So, each edge will have a cut 1 cm from the vertex and 3 cm from the opposite end.\n\nSo, for each edge, the plane cuts it 1 cm from the vertex.

What is the volume of the resulting solid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the volume of a solid formed by rotating a square with side length 2 units around an axis that goes through two opposite vertices. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me draw a square in my mind. It's a square, so all sides are equal, each 2 units long. Now, the axis of rotation is in the same plane as the square and passes through two opposite vertices. So, if I imagine the square lying flat on a table, the axis would be a line that goes through one corner and the opposite corner, like the diagonal of the square.\n\nWait, is that right? So, if the square is on the table, the axis is the diagonal. So, when we rotate the square around this diagonal, what shape does it make? Hmm, I think it might form some sort of three-dimensional figure. Maybe a double cone or something? Or maybe two cones connected at their bases?\n\nLet me think. When you rotate a shape around an axis, the volume can be found using methods like the disk method or the shell method. Maybe I can use one of those here. Since the axis is a diagonal, which is a line in the same plane as the square, maybe I can model this as a double cone.\n\nWait, actually, when you rotate a square around a diagonal, it creates a shape that is like two cones attached at their bases. Each cone has a base radius equal to half the diagonal of the square, right? Because the diagonal divides the square into two triangles, each of which will trace out a cone when rotated.\n\nLet me confirm that. The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Since each side is 2 units, the diagonal length is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2) units. So, half of that would be sqrt(",
            "annotated_chain": "[\"initializing\"]Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the volume of a solid formed by rotating a square with side length 2 units around an axis that goes through two opposite vertices.[\"end-section\"][\"initializing\"]Hmm, let me try to visualize this.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]First, let me draw a square in my mind.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]It's a square, so all sides are equal, each 2 units long.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Now, the axis of rotation is in the same plane as the square and passes through two opposite vertices.[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"]So, if I imagine the square lying flat on a table, the axis would be a line that goes through one corner and the opposite corner, like the diagonal of the square.[\"end-section\"][\"uncertainty-estimation\"]Wait, is that right?[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]So, if the square is on the table, the axis is the diagonal.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]So, when we rotate the square around this diagonal, what shape does it make?[\"end-section\"][\"uncertainty-estimation\"]Hmm, I think it might form some sort of three-dimensional figure.[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"]Maybe a double cone or something?[\"end-section\"][\"example-testing\"]Or maybe two cones connected at their bases?[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Let me think.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]When you rotate a shape around an axis, the volume can be found using methods like the disk method or the shell method.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Maybe I can use one of those here.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Since the axis is a diagonal, which is a line in the same plane as the square, maybe I can model this as a double cone.[\"end-section\"][\"backtracking\"]Wait, actually, when you rotate a square around a diagonal, it creates a shape that is like two cones attached at their bases.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Each cone has a base radius equal to half the diagonal of the square, right?[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]Because the diagonal divides the square into two triangles, each of which will trace out a cone when rotated.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]Let me confirm that.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]Since each side is 2 units, the diagonal length is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2) units.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]So, half of that would be sqrt("
