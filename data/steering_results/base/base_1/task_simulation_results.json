Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand it properly and don't skip any steps. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a number to be odd or even. An integer is even if it's divisible by 2, right? So, an even number can be written as 2 times some integer, like 2k where k is an integer. On the other hand, an odd number can't be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. So, it's like 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nAlright, so if n squared is odd, that means n\u00b2 is not divisible by 2. So, n\u00b2 is equal to some odd integer. Let me write this down:\n\nn\u00b2 = odd.\n\nI need to show that n itself must be odd. So, if n squared is odd, then n is odd. Hmm, how do I connect n and n squared? Maybe I can think about the possible parity of n. Parity refers to whether a number is even or odd, right? So, every integer has a parity: even or odd.\n\nLet me consider two cases: when n is even and when n is odd. Maybe that will help.\n\nCase 1: Suppose n is even. Then, n can be written as 2k for some integer k. Let's compute n squared in this case.\n\nn = 2k\n\nn\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2\n\nSo, n squared is 4k squared, which is clearly divisible by 2 because 4 is 2 times 2. So, if n is even, n squared is even.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that n squared is odd. So, if n squared is odd, this case can't happen because 4k\u00b2 is even. Therefore, our assumption that n is even must be wrong. So, n cannot be even; hence, n must be odd.\n\nCase 2: Just to be thorough, let's consider if n is odd. Then, n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nn = 2k + 1\n\nLet's compute n squared.\n\nn\u00b2 = (2k + 1", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": [], "btk_llm": ["But wait, the problem states that n squared is odd."], "btk_manual": ["But wait, the problem states that n squared is odd."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_2", "task_problem": "Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational using a proof by contradiction.", "task_answer": "Alright, so I need to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational using a proof by contradiction. Hmm, okay, I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and then show that this leads to a contradiction. So, if I assume that the square root of 2 is rational, then I should try to show that this assumption leads to something impossible.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a rational number is. A rational number can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if sqrt(2) is rational, then there exist integers a and b such that sqrt(2) = a/b, and the fraction is in its simplest form, meaning that a and b have no common divisors other than 1.\n\nSo, let me write that down: Assume sqrt(2) = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common divisors other than 1, and b is not zero.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. Then, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2, I get 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. This implies that a\u00b2 is equal to 2b\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so a\u00b2 = 2b\u00b2. That means that a must be divisible by 2, right? Because 2 divides a\u00b2. If 2 divides a\u00b2, then 2 must divide a. Wait, is that always true? I think so, because if 2 divides a\u00b2, then a must be even. Let me think about this. If a is odd, then a\u00b2 is odd, because an odd times an odd is odd. So, if a is odd, a\u00b2 is odd, which can't be equal to 2b\u00b2, which is even. Therefore, a must be even. So, a is divisible by 2.\n\nOkay, so a = 2k, where k is some integer. Let me substitute that back into the equation. So, a\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2. So, 4k\u00b2 = 2b\u00b2. Then, dividing both sides by 2, we get 2k\u00b2 = b\u00b2. So, b\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, this is similar to the original equation, but now with", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["Wait, is that always true?"], "btk_llm": [], "btk_manual": ["Wait, is that always true?"]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_3", "task_problem": "Determine whether the following statement is a tautology, contradiction, or neither: (P \u2192 Q) \u2194 (~Q \u2192 ~P).", "task_answer": "Alright, so I have this logical statement to evaluate: (P \u2192 Q) \u2194 (~Q \u2192 ~P).

So, I need to check if (P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to (~Q \u2192 ~P). \n\nFirst, let me recall what each part means. P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q, right? That's one way to rewrite it. Similarly, ~Q \u2192 ~P is equivalent to P \u2228 ~Q. Wait, isn't that the same as ~P \u2228 Q? So, if both (P \u2192 Q) and (~Q \u2192 ~P) are equivalent to the same thing, then they should be equivalent to each other. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should construct a truth table to make sure. Let me list all possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nSo, P can be true or false, and Q can be true or false.

Wait, F \u2192 F is T because an implication is only false when the antecedent is T and the consequent is F. So, ~Q is F, ~P is F, so F \u2192 F is T.\n- So both sides are T, so equivalence holds.\n\nCase 2: P is true, Q is false.\n- P \u2192 Q: T \u2192 F is F.\n- ~Q \u2192 ~P: T \u2192 T is T.\n- So, one side is F and the other is T.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that truth tables are a fundamental part of propositional logic, and they help in evaluating the truth values of complex statements by considering all possible combinations of truth values for the individual propositions involved. \n\nFirst, let me recall what each symbol represents. P and Q are propositions, which can be either true (T) or false (F). The logical connectives here are \u2227 (and), \u2192 (implies), and \u00ac (negation). So, the statement is: If both P and Q are true, then either not P or Q is true. \n\nI know that the implication operator \u2192 can be a bit tricky, so maybe I should remember that (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B). So, (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 (~P \u2228 Q) can be rewritten as \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) \u2228 (\u00acP \u2228 Q). Let me see if that helps. \n\nWait, let me make sure. The implication (A \u2192 B) is equivalent to (\u00acA \u2228 B), right? So, if I rewrite (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 (~P \u2228 Q), it would be \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) \u2228 (~P \u2228 Q). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to approach it. Maybe I should just stick with the original form and evaluate each part step by step.\n\nSo, the statement is (P \u2227 Q) \u2192 (~P \u2228 Q). Let's break it down. The antecedent is (P \u2227 Q), and the consequent is (~P \u2228 Q). To evaluate the entire implication, I need to consider all possible truth values for P and Q and then compute the truth values for each part.\n\nSince there are two propositions, P and Q, each can be either true or false. So, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations. Let me list them out:\n\n1. P is true, Q is true\n2. P is true, Q is false\n3. P is false, Q is true\n4.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand what all the terms mean. A set A is a subset of B if every element in A is also in B. Similarly, B is a subset of C means every element in B is in C. So, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, does that necessarily mean A is a subset of C?\n\nWell, let me try to visualize this. Let's say I have three overlapping circles representing sets A, B, and C. If A is inside B, and B is inside C, then A should also be inside C, right? But wait, is that always the case? I think so, but I need to make sure.\n\nMaybe I should start by recalling the formal definition of a subset. A set A is a subset of B if for all elements x, if x is in A, then x is also in B. Similarly, B is a subset of C if for all elements y, if y is in B, then y is in C. So, if I can connect these two, maybe I can show that for any element in A, it must also be in C.\n\nLet me try to write this out formally. Let x be an arbitrary element in A. Since A is a subset of B, x must be in B. Now, since B is a subset of C, x must also be in C. Therefore, every element in A is in C, which means A is a subset of C. Yeah, that seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that some elements in A might not be in C? Hmm, if A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A can't have any elements that aren't in C because all elements of B are in C, and all elements of A are in B. So, it's like a chain: A is inside B, which is inside C, so A is inside C.\n\nMaybe another way to think about it is using logical implications.

Hmm, induction is something I remember involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. I think I have to check if the formula holds true for n = 1. So, plugging in n = 1, the left side becomes 1, right? Because the series is 1 when n=1. The right side would be 1*(3*1 - 1)/2, which is 1*(3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, 1 equals 1, which is true. Cool, the base case works.\n\nNow, the inductive step. Here, I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then show that it must also hold for k + 1.

It would be 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) + (3(k + 1) - 2). Wait, that's the same as the sum up to k terms plus the next term, which is 3(k + 1) - 2.\n\nSimplifying the next term: 3(k + 1) - 2 = 3k + 3 - 2 = 3k + 1.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, statements like this usually involve quantifiers. The statement says there exists a real number x with a certain property. So, I think I'll need to use the existential quantifier, which is usually written as \u2203. Then, the property it has is that for all real numbers y, x is less than or equal to y. \n\nSo, breaking it down: \"There exists an x\" translates to \u2203x. Then, the property is \"for all y, x \u2264 y.\" The \"for all\" part is a universal quantifier, which is written as \u2200. So, putting that together, I think it would be \u2203x \u2200y (x \u2264 y). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. The original statement is saying that there is one specific x that is less than or equal to every real number y. So, is that possible? Hmm, in real numbers, if x is a real number, can it be less than or equal to every y? Well, if we're talking about real numbers, if x is the smallest possible real number, which is negative infinity, but infinity isn't a real number. So, actually, no real number can be less than or equal to every real number y because for any real x, there exists a y that's smaller. Wait, but does that matter for this problem? The problem doesn't specify anything about x and y other than x being a real number and y being a real number.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is just asking to convert the statement into a symbolic form, regardless of its truth value. So, I should focus on translating the words into the correct logical symbols. \n\nSo, \"There exists a real number x\" is \u2203x \u2208 \u211d, where \u211d is the set of real numbers. Then, \"for all real numbers y, x is less than or equal to y\" would be \u2200y \u2208 \u211d, x \u2264 y.

In mathematical terms, that is P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) \u2229 P(B). Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, let me recall what a power set is. The power set of a set X, denoted as P(X), is the set of all subsets of X. So, for any two sets A and B, P(A) contains all subsets of A, and P(B) contains all subsets of B. Now, the statement is saying that if I take the intersection of A and B, then take the power set of that intersection, it should be the same as taking the intersection of the power sets of A and B. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract. Maybe I should try with some examples.\n\nLet me pick two simple sets to test this. Let\u2019s say A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Then, A \u2229 B is {2}. The power set of A, P(A), is {{}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}, and P(B) is {{}, {2}, {3}, {2,3}}. Now, P(A \u2229 B) is P({2}), which is {{}, {2}}.

So in this case, P(A \u2229 B) equals P(A) \u2229 P(B). Okay, that works.\n\nLet me try another example where maybe the intersection is empty. Let A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4}.

And it also says that the streets are not wet. The question is, what can we conclude from these two premises? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, when you have a conditional statement like \"If P, then Q,\" it's written as P \u2192 Q. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent. I think that might be useful here because the second premise is giving me a not Q situation.\n\nSo, the first premise is P \u2192 Q, where P is \"It is raining\" and Q is \"The streets are wet.\" The contrapositive of that would be ~Q \u2192 ~P.

(~Q)\n\nFrom these, can I conclude that it is not raining? So, using the contrapositive, ~Q \u2192 ~P. Since we have ~Q (streets not wet), then ~P (it is not raining). So, yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes in logic, just because the contrapositive is true, does that always mean the conclusion follows? Let me think. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa. So, if we have ~Q, then ~P must follow.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine a truth table. The original statement P \u2192 Q has four possible truth values:\n\n- P is true, Q is true: P \u2192 Q is true\n- P is true, Q is false: P \u2192 Q is false\n- P is false, Q is true: P \u2192 Q is true\n- P is false, Q is false: P \u2192 Q is true\n\nSimilarly,", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["Wait, but the second premise says that the streets are not wet.", "Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here."], "btk_llm": [], "btk_manual": ["Wait, but the second premise says that the streets are not wet.", "Wait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_10", "task_problem": "Prove by contrapositive that if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.", "task_answer": "Okay, so I need to prove by contraposition that if n squared is even, then n is even.

So, if the original statement is \"If P, then Q,\" the contrapositive is \"If not Q, then not P.\" But wait, in this case, the original statement is \"If n squared is even, then n is even.\" So, the contrapositive would be \"If n is not even, then n squared is not even.\" That makes sense because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAlright, so my goal is to show that if n is not even, then n squared isn't even either. Let me break it down. First, what does it mean for a number to be even? An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. So, if n is not even, that means it's an odd number. Odd numbers are integers that can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, let me denote n as 2k + 1, where k is some integer.\n\nNow, let's compute n squared. If n is 2k + 1, then n squared would be (2k + 1)^2. Let me expand that. (2k + 1)^2 is equal to 4k squared plus 4k plus 1. So, that's 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, let me factor that a bit more. I can factor out a 4 from the first two terms, which gives 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1. So, n squared is 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1.\n\nNow, let me think about whether this is even or odd. The term 4(k\u00b2 + k) is clearly a multiple of 4, which means it's even. Adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. Therefore, n squared is equal to an even number plus 1, which makes it odd. So, if n is odd, then n squared is odd. \n\nWait, so the contrapositive says that if n is not even, then n squared is not even. Which is exactly what I just proved.

Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what these statements mean. The first one, \u2200x\u2203y(P(x,y)), is read as \"For all x, there exists a y such that P(x,y) holds.\" So, for every element x in the domain, I can find some y (maybe different for each x) where P(x,y) is true. The second one, \u2203y\u2200x(P(x,y)), is \"There exists a y such that for all x, P(x,y) holds.\" That means there's a single y that works for every x. \n\nSo, in simpler terms, the first one allows y to depend on x, while the second one requires y to be the same for all x. That makes me think they aren't equivalent because the way y is related to x is different in each case.\n\nBut I need to come up with a concrete example to show they aren't equivalent. Maybe I can use a domain with specific elements and a predicate P that behaves differently in each case. Let me think about a simple domain. Maybe something like the set of people and a relation like \"is a parent of.\"\n\nWait, let's try something else. How about using numbers? Let's say we're working with natural numbers. Let me define a predicate P(x,y) as \"y is greater than x.\" So, P(x,y) is true if y > x.\n\nNow, let's evaluate \u2200x\u2203y(P(x,y)). For each x, I need a y such that y > x. Well, for any x, I can choose y = x + 1, which is greater than x. So, this statement is true.\n\nWhat about \u2203y\u2200x(P(x,y))? Here, I need a single y that is greater than every x. But wait, no matter what y I pick, if x is greater than y, then P(x,y) would be false. For example, if I choose y = 5, then for x = 6, P(6,5) is false because 5 is not greater than 6.

Hmm, okay. Hmm, I think I can use mathematical induction for this. Let me recall how mathematical induction works.\n\nFirst, I remember that induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where I show that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually \\( n = 1 \\). Then, the inductive step is where I assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\) and then show it must also be true for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. Let me plug in \\( n = 1 \\) into \\( n^3 - n \\). So, that's \\( 1^3 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \\). Zero divided by 3 is zero, which is an integer, so yes, it's divisible by 3. So, the base case checks out.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let's assume that for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), \\( k^3 - k \\) is divisible by 3.

Let's compute \\( (k + 1)^3 - (k + 1) \\). Expanding \\( (k + 1)^3 \\), I remember that \\( (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 \\). So, substituting \\( a = k \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), we get:\n\n\\( (k + 1)^3 = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 \\)\n\nSo, subtracting \\( (k + 1) \\) from both sides, we have:\n\n\\( (k + 1)^3 - (k + 1) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 - k - 1 \\)\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": [], "btk_llm": [], "btk_manual": []}, {"task_id": "math_logic_13", "task_problem": "Prove or disprove the statement: For all sets A, B, and C, (A - B) - C = A - (B - C).", "task_answer": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether the statement (A - B) - C equals A - (B - C) is true for all sets A, B, and C. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what set operations I'm dealing with here. The minus sign in set notation represents set difference, which is the set of elements in the first set that are not in the second set. So, A - B would be all elements that are in A but not in B. Similarly, B - C would be all elements in B but not in C.\n\nOkay, so the left-hand side of the equation is (A - B) - C. Let me parse that. That means we're taking the set difference of A and B first, which gives us all elements in A not in B, and then subtracting C from that result. So, it's like taking everything that's in (A - B) but not in C.\n\nOn the right-hand side, we have A - (B - C). This is a bit trickier because of the parentheses. Here, we're subtracting the set (B - C) from A. So, that would be all elements in A that are not in (B - C). But (B - C) is all elements in B not in C, so subtracting that from A would mean all elements in A that are not in (B - C). Which is the same as all elements in A that are either in C or not in B. Hmm, let me make sure I'm getting this right.\n\nMaybe I should think about this in terms of Venn diagrams. Let me visualize three circles representing sets A, B, and C. If I first subtract B from A, that would remove the part of A that overlaps with B, leaving only the part of A that's outside B. Then subtracting C from that would remove the part of (A - B) that overlaps with C, right?

Syllogisms have two premises and a conclusion, and I need to determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nSo, the premises here are:\n1. If I study, I will pass the exam.\n2. If I pass the exam, I will graduate.\n\nAnd the conclusion is: I did not graduate. Therefore, I did not study.\n\nAlright, let's represent this in a more structured form.

S \u2192 P\n2. P \u2192 G\n\nThe conclusion is: \u00acG (I did not graduate). Therefore, \u00acS (I did not study).\n\nWait, so the conclusion is saying that if I didn't graduate, then I didn't study. But is that a valid inference based on the premises?\n\nI think this might be an example of a logical fallacy. Let me recall the types of syllogisms. There are four basic types: Barbara, Celarent, Darii, and Festino. I think this might be a case of the Darii syllogism, which is an invalid type. Darii has the form:\n\nAll M are P.\nAll S are M.\nTherefore, all S are P.\n\nBut that's not exactly what we have here. Maybe it's better to look at the logical structure.\n\nIn logic, implications can be converted and contraposed.

Similarly, the contrapositive of P \u2192 G is \u00acG \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSo, from the premises, we have S \u2192 P and P \u2192 G.

Provide specific examples.", "task_answer": "Okay, so I need to prove that the sum of two irrational numbers can be rational and also provide specific examples. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, what exactly are irrational numbers? From what I remember, irrational numbers are numbers that can't be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. Examples include numbers like \u221a2 or \u03c0. On the other hand, rational numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3, because their decimal expansions either terminate or repeat.\n\nSo, the question is asking if adding two numbers that can't be expressed as fractions can result in a number that can be expressed as a fraction. That is, can \u221a2 + \u221a3 be rational? Or is there a pair of irrationals that add up to a rational number?\n\nLet me start by considering what happens when we add two irrational numbers. If I take \u221a2 and another irrational number, say \u221a2 again, their sum would be 2\u221a2, which is still irrational. That doesn't help. What if I take different irrationals? Maybe something like \u221a2 and (1 - \u221a2). Let me calculate that: \u221a2 is approximately 1.4142, and 1 - \u221a2 is about -0.4142. Adding them together gives 1. So, 1 is a rational number. Wait, that's a good example!\n\nBut let me verify that. \u221a2 is irrational, 1 - \u221a2 is also irrational because if it were rational, adding \u221a2 would make it irrational, right? So, both numbers are irrational, and their sum is 1, which is rational. That works.\n\nBut is that the only way? Let me think of another example. How about \u03c0 and -\u03c0? \u03c0 is irrational, and -\u03c0 is also irrational, but their sum is 0, which is rational. That's another example.\n\nWait, so the key idea here is that if I have an irrational number and its additive inverse, their sum is zero, which is rational. That makes sense because adding a number and its negative counterpart cancels them out. So, that's a straightforward way to get a rational sum.\n\nLet me think if there are other examples. Maybe something like \u221a3 and -\u221a3. Their sum is zero, which is rational.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that negations can sometimes be tricky, especially with quantifiers. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original statement is a universal statement followed by an existential quantifier. It says, \"For all x, there exists a y such that if P(x), then Q(y).\" So, in plain English, this might translate to something like, \"For every x, there is some y that makes Q(y) true whenever P(x) is true.\" \n\nI recall that the negation of a universal quantifier (\u2200) is an existential quantifier (\u2203), and the negation of an implication (\u2192) is (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ). So, applying that, the negation should involve switching the order of the quantifiers and negating the implication.\n\nLet me write this out. The original statement is \u2200x\u2203y(P(x) \u2192 Q(y)). To negate it, I would start by negating the entire statement. So, \u00ac(\u2200x\u2203y(P(x) \u2192 Q(y))). \n\nNow, the inner part is an implication, P(x) \u2192 Q(y). The negation of that is \u00ac(P(x) \u2192 Q(y)), which is equivalent to P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y). So, putting it all together, the negation becomes \u2203x\u2200y(P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y)). \n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, if I have \u2200x\u2203y, then the negation would be \u2203x\u2200y, right? Because negating \u2200x becomes \u2203x, and vice versa. So, the order of the quantifiers flips. So, it's not just flipping one, but both. \n\nSo, starting with \u2200x\u2203y, the negation is \u2203x\u2200y. Then, the inner statement P(x) \u2192 Q(y) becomes P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y). So, putting it all together, the negation is \u2203x\u2200y(P(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(y)). \n\nLet me test this with an example to see if it makes sense.

Hmm, okay. I remember that proof by contradiction is when you assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So in this case, I need to assume that there are not infinitely many prime numbers, and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Now, the statement that I need to prove is that there are infinitely many of these primes.\n\nSo, if I'm using proof by contradiction, I should first assume the opposite. That is, I will assume that there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let me write that down:\n\n**Assumption**: There are only finitely many prime numbers. Let's say the primes are p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, ..., p\u2099.\n\nOkay, so if there are only finitely many primes, then there exists a largest prime number, which we can call p\u2099. Now, I need to find a contradiction from this assumption. How can I do that?\n\nI remember something about the Euclidean algorithm and the concept of prime gaps. Maybe I can use that. The Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. If I can show that assuming only finitely many primes leads to some number that should have a prime divisor not in our list, that would be a contradiction.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have two numbers, say, 2 and the sum of all primes plus one. Wait, no, that might not necessarily lead to a contradiction. Maybe I should consider the number 2 and another prime, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the idea that for any number, you can subtract a prime and get another number, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of Euclid's proof for the infinity of primes.

Hmm, okay. I've heard of implications in logic before, so maybe I can use some of that knowledge here. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what implication means in logic. If I have P \u2192 Q, that means whenever P is true, Q must also be true. Similarly, Q \u2192 R means that if Q is true, then R must be true. So, we're saying that if P leads to Q, and Q leads to R, then P should lead to R as well. That makes sense intuitively because if P causes Q and Q causes R, then P should cause R through the chain.\n\nBut wait, how do I translate this into a formal proof? I remember something about using contrapositive or truth tables. Maybe the contrapositive is the way to go here. The contrapositive of P \u2192 R would be \u00acR \u2192 \u00acP. So, if I can show that \u00acR implies \u00acP, then I can conclude P \u2192 R.\n\nLet me write down the given statements:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (Given)\n2. Q \u2192 R (Given)\n\nI need to prove that P \u2192 R. To do this, I'll use the contrapositive approach. So, assume that R is false and show that P must also be false.\n\nAssume \u00acR (That is, R is false). Since Q \u2192 R is true, the contrapositive of Q \u2192 R is \u00acR \u2192 \u00acQ. So, if R is false, then Q must be false. So, from \u00acR, we get \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we have \u00acQ. Looking at the first statement P \u2192 Q, the contrapositive of that is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. So, if Q is false, then P must be false. Therefore, from \u00acQ, we can conclude \u00acP.\n\nSo, starting from \u00acR, we deduced \u00acQ, and then from \u00acQ, we deduced \u00acP. Therefore, if R is false, P must also be false. This means that if P were true, R would have to be true to avoid a contradiction. Hence, P \u2192 R must be true.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.

In symbols, that's (A \u222a B)' = A' \u2229 B'. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in set theory, the complement of a set is all the elements not in that set. So, if I have two sets A and B, their union A \u222a B is all the elements that are in A, in B, or in both. Then, the complement of that union, (A \u222a B)', should be all the elements not in A or B. On the other hand, the intersection of their complements A' \u2229 B' would be all the elements that are not in A and not in B. So, at first glance, it seems like these two should be the same, right? Because both are describing elements that are neither in A nor in B.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check this with some examples. Let me pick some specific sets and see if this holds.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the universal set U, which is the set of all possible elements we're considering. Let's say U = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Now, let me choose specific sets A and B within U.\n\nSuppose A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}. Then, A \u222a B would be {1, 2, 3}. The complement of that, (A \u222a B)', would be {4}, since 4 is the only element not in A \u222a B. \n\nNow, A' is the complement of A, which is {3, 4}, and B' is the complement of B, which is {1, 4}. The intersection of A' and B' would be {4}, since 4 is the only element common to both A' and B'. So in this case, (A \u222a B)' equals A' \u2229 B', which is {4} = {4}. That works.\n\nWait, maybe try another example to be sure. Let me take A = {1} and B = {2}.

The problem states that n should be 5 or greater, so maybe I should start with n = 5. Let me compute 2\u2075 and 5\u00b2. \n\n2\u2075 is 32, and 5\u00b2 is 25. So, 32 is definitely greater than 25.

Assuming 2\u1d4f > k\u00b2, I need to prove that 2^(k+1) > (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nI know that 2^(k+1) is equal to 2 * 2\u1d4f. So, substituting the inductive hypothesis into this, that gives me 2 * 2\u1d4f. Since I know 2\u1d4f > k\u00b2, then 2 * 2\u1d4f > 2 * k\u00b2. So, 2^(k+1) > 2k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that 2k\u00b2 > (k+1)\u00b2. Let me expand (k+1)\u00b2. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like a/b where a and b are integers and b isn't zero. Irrational numbers, on the other hand, can't be expressed as such fractions. So, the task is to show that if I have two different rational numbers, there must be some irrational number sitting right between them.\n\nLet me start by recalling what it means for two numbers to be distinct. If I have two rational numbers, say r1 and r2, and r1 \u2260 r2, then they are two different points on the number line. I need to find an irrational number between them. I think I remember something about the density of rational and irrational numbers, but maybe I don't need that. Perhaps I can use the properties of rational numbers to construct an irrational number in between.\n\nI remember something about the average of two numbers. If I take the average of r1 and r2, that should give me a number between them. Let's test that. The average is (r1 + r2)/2. Since both r1 and r2 are rational, their sum is rational, and dividing a rational number by 2 (which is also rational) gives another rational number. So, the average is rational. Hmm, that doesn't help because I need an irrational number.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a different approach. What if I consider the decimal expansions of r1 and r2? Let me think. Suppose r1 is less than r2. So, r1 < r2. If I write them as decimals, maybe I can find a point where they differ and insert an irrational number there. For example, if r1 = 1.5 and r2 = 2.5, then between them is 2, which is rational. But that's not helpful. But wait, maybe if I take a different approach.\n\nI recall that if you have two distinct real numbers, there's always a rational number between them. But that's the opposite of what I need.

Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what implication means in logic. If I have P(x) \u2192 Q(x), that means whenever P(x) is true, Q(x) must also be true. Similarly, Q(x) \u2192 R(x) means that whenever Q(x) is true, R(x) must be true. So, if I can connect P(x) to R(x) through Q(x), maybe I can chain these implications together.\n\nLet me think about how implications work. If P implies Q, and Q implies R, then does P imply R? I think that's the transitive property of implication, but I'm not entirely sure how to formally prove it. Maybe I should use some rules of inference or natural deduction.\n\nIn natural deduction, implications can be handled by assuming the antecedent and deriving the consequent. So, starting with P(x), if I assume P(x), then by the first premise, Q(x) must be true. Then, since Q(x) is true, by the second premise, R(x) must also be true. Therefore, if I assume P(x), I can derive R(x), which means P(x) implies R(x). \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but is that enough?

From the first premise, since P(x) is true, Q(x) must be true. So, we can infer Q(x).\n3. Now, assuming Q(x), from the second premise, R(x) must be true. So, we can infer R(x).\n4. Therefore, from assuming P(x), we derived R(x), which means P(x) implies R(x).\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Another way to think about it is through truth tables. If I construct a truth table for all possible truth values of P(x), Q(x), and R(x), I can see if the implication holds.\n\nLet me try that.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what odd and even integers are first. An even integer is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer, right? So, like 2, 4, 6, -2, -4, etc. And an odd integer is any integer that can be written as 2n + 1, where n is an integer. So, numbers like 1, 3, 5, -1, -3, and so on.\n\nOkay, so if I have an odd integer, let's call it 'a', and an even integer, let's call it 'b'. So, I can write a as 2k + 1, where k is some integer, and b as 2m, where m is also some integer. Now, I need to add them together: a + b = (2k + 1) + 2m. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me distribute the addition: 2k + 1 + 2m. Hmm, I can rearrange the terms: 2k + 2m + 1. Now, 2k + 2m is equal to 2(k + m), right? Because 2k + 2m is the same as 2 times (k + m). So, now the expression becomes 2(k + m) + 1.\n\nWait, so 2(k + m) is an even integer because it's 2 multiplied by some integer (k + m). And then we're adding 1 to it. So, even plus 1 is odd. Therefore, 2(k + m) + 1 is an odd integer.\n\nSo, putting it all together: a + b = (2k + 1) + 2m = 2(k + m) + 1, which is odd. Therefore, the sum of an odd integer and an even integer is odd. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this, just to double-check.\n\nAnother way might be to consider the definition of even and odd numbers in terms of their parity.

The union of two sets includes all elements that are in either of the sets. So, A is {1, 2, 3} and B is {2, 3, 4}.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, let me recall what rational and irrational numbers are. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating.

That makes sense intuitively because multiplying a rational number by an irrational one shouldn't make it rational again. But I need to prove it formally.\n\nLet me denote the non-zero rational number as \\( q \\) and the irrational number as \\( r \\). So, \\( q \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, and \\( b \\) is not zero. \\( r \\) cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.\n\nI need to show that \\( q \\times r \\) is irrational.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's clarify what is being asked. We have a finite set X with n elements, and we want to count how many different functions there are from X to the set {0, 1}. Each function takes each element in X and assigns it to either 0 or 1. So, for each element in X, there are two choices: 0 or 1.\n\nMaybe I can start by considering smaller cases to see the pattern. Let me take n=1. If X has only one element, say X = {x1}, then the functions from X to {0,1} would be two functions: one that maps x1 to 0 and another that maps x1 to 1. So, that's 2^1 = 2 functions. That makes sense.\n\nWhat about n=2? Let X = {x1, x2}. Now, for each element, we can independently choose 0 or 1. So, for x1, we have two choices, and for x2, we also have two choices. So, the total number of functions would be 2 * 2 = 4. Which is 2^2. Okay, so that works too.\n\nWait, so for each element in X, the function is like making a binary choice for each element. So, if X has n elements, each with two choices, the total number of functions should be 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should think about this more formally. Let's denote X = {x1, x2, ..., xn}. A function f: X \u2192 {0,1} assigns to each xi a value in {0,1}. So, f(x1), f(x2), ..., f(xn) are each either 0 or 1. Each of these assignments is independent, right?

It's defined as F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and for n > 2, F\u2099 = F\u2099\u208b\u2081 + F\u2099\u208b\u2082.

So, mathematically, that's:\n\n1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + ... + F\u2099 = F\u2099\u208a\u2082 - 1.\n\nAlright, let me start with the base case. When n = 1, the left side is just F\u2081, which is 1. The right side should be F\u2081\u208a\u2082 - 1, which is F\u2083 - 1. Let's compute F\u2083. Since F\u2083 = F\u2082 + F\u2081 = 1 + 1 = 2. So, F\u2083 - 1 is 2 - 1 = 1.

So, if I can show that (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 P isn't always true, then it's not a tautology. I can do this by either constructing a truth table or providing a counterexample. The problem suggests using a truth table, so I'll try that approach.\n\nAlright, let's recall the logical equivalences that might help here. The statement (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 P can be rewritten using implications. Remember that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, substituting that in, we get (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2192 P. Another way to write that is \u00ac(\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2228 P, which simplifies to P \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 P. Using the distributive law, that becomes P \u2228 (P \u2227 \u00acQ). Since P \u2228 anything is just P, this simplifies to P. Wait, so (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 P simplifies to P? That's interesting. So, if I follow the logical equivalences, (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 P is equivalent to P. \n\nBut hold on, if it's equivalent to P, then isn't that just P? So, if P is a tautology, then so is (P \u2192 Q) \u2192 P. But that doesn't make sense because the original statement is asking me to prove it's not a tautology.

So, if I add those two together, it should give me a + b. But why is that? Let me consider different scenarios.\n\nMaybe I should break it down into cases. Since there are only two possibilities for a and b relative to each other: either a is greater than or equal to b, or b is greater than or equal to a. That makes sense. So, let me start by assuming that a is greater than or equal to b. \n\nCase 1: a \u2265 b. In this case, max(a, b) is a, because a is the larger number.

So, the negation of \u2200x\u2203y\u2200z something would be \u2203x\u2200y\u2203z such that not something.\n\nBut wait, actually, the negation of \u2200x\u2203y\u2200z (A \u2194 B) is not just simply flipping the quantifiers; I need to handle the implication as well.\n\nLet me recall that P \u2194 Q is logically equivalent to (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 P). So, maybe I can break down the original statement into two implications and then negate each part separately.\n\nSo, the original statement is equivalent to:\n\u2200x\u2203y\u2200z (P(x, y, z) \u2192 Q(x, y)) \u2227 \u2200x\u2203y\u2200z (Q(x, y) \u2192 P(x, y, z))\n\nSo, that's two separate statements: one saying that P implies Q, and the other that Q implies P, for all x, there exists y, and for all z.\n\nTherefore, the negation of the original statement would be the negation of both these implications. Since negation distributes over conjunction, the negation would be:\n\n\u00ac[\u2200x\u2203", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["But let me make sure I recall correctly."], "btk_llm": ["But wait, actually, the negation of \u2200x\u2203y\u2200z (A \u2194 B) is not just simply flipping the quantifiers; I need to handle the implication as well."], "btk_manual": ["But let me make sure I recall correctly.", "But wait, actually, the negation of \u2200x\u2203y\u2200z (A \u2194 B) is not just simply flipping the quantifiers; I need to handle the implication as well."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_33", "task_problem": "Prove or disprove: If A and B are countable sets, then A \u00d7 B is countable, where A \u00d7 B is the Cartesian product of A and B.", "task_answer": "Okay, so I have this question: If A and B are countable sets, is their Cartesian product A \u00d7 B also countable? Hmm, I remember that countable means that the set can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, right? So, like, you can list them out in a sequence without missing any. \n\nFirst off, let me recall what a Cartesian product is. A \u00d7 B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B. So if A and B are both countable, does that mean we can list all these pairs in some order? I think so, but I need to figure out how.\n\nI remember something about countable and uncountable sets. The Cartesian product of two countable sets is countable if and only if at least one of them is finite. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, if both A and B are countably infinite, then A \u00d7 B is also countable. Because you can enumerate them in a diagonal manner, like using a pairing function. \n\nBut wait, if one of them is finite, then A \u00d7 B is countable because finite times countable is countable. So, in general, the Cartesian product of a finite set with any set is countable. But in this question, both A and B are countable, so regardless of whether they're finite or infinite, their product should be countable.\n\nBut I should verify this. Let me think about some examples. Suppose A is the set of natural numbers N, and B is also N. Then A \u00d7 B is N \u00d7 N, which is the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers. I know that N \u00d7 N is countable because you can list them in a sequence, like (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and so on. So that works.\n\nWhat if A and B are both countable but infinite? Like, say, A is the integers and B is the even integers. Then A \u00d7 B would be all ordered pairs where the first component is an integer and the second is an even integer. Is this set countable? Hmm, let's see.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that in logic, two statements are equivalent if they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios. So, maybe I can start by constructing a truth table that lists all the possible truth values for P and Q, and then compute the truth values for both (P \u2192 Q) and (~P \u2228 Q). If they match for all combinations, then they are logically equivalent.\n\nAlright, let me recall what a truth table looks like. It has rows for each possible combination of truth values for the propositions involved, which in this case are P and Q. Since there are two propositions, P and Q, each can be either true (T) or false (F). So, there are four possible combinations: TT, TF, FT, FF. I should make a table with these rows and then evaluate (P \u2192 Q) and (~P \u2228 Q) for each.\n\nLet me write that down.\n\nFirst, the truth table structure:\n\n| P | Q | ~P | ~P \u2228 Q | P \u2192 Q |\n|---|---|----|---------|--------|\n| T | T | F  |         |        |\n| T | F | F  |         |        |\n| F | T | T  |         |        |\n| F | F | T  |         |        |\n\nOkay, now I need to fill in each column step by step.\n\nStarting with the first row: P=T, Q=T.\n\nFor ~P: If P is true, then ~P is false.

Hmm, interesting. I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\nThe question is asking about expressing every positive integer as a product of primes. That sounds like factoring the number into its prime components. For example, 6 can be written as 2 \u00d7 3, which are both primes. 8 can be written as 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which is 2\u00b3. So, even for composite numbers, we can break them down into primes. But what about 1? Hmm, 1 is a positive integer, but it's neither prime nor composite. So, how do we express 1 as a product of primes? Well, 1 can be considered as the product of zero primes, I guess. Or maybe the empty product. That might be a bit abstract, but I think it's acceptable in mathematics.\n\nWait, but let me not get ahead of myself. The problem is about every positive integer. So, starting from 1, 2, 3, and so on. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something called the Well-Ordering Principle, which states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nSo, how do I apply the Well-Ordering Principle to show that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of primes? Let's try to think inductively. Maybe I can start with smaller numbers and build up.\n\nLet's consider the base case. For 1, as I thought before, it can be considered as the product of zero primes. So, that's the base case.\n\nNow, assume that every positive integer less than n can be expressed as a product of primes. Now, let's consider the number n. If n is a prime number, then by definition, it cannot be factored further into smaller positive integers other than 1 and itself. So, in this case, n is already a prime, so it's the product of one prime. So, the induction hypothesis holds for primes.\n\nIf n is not a prime, then it must be composite.

The original statement is \u2203x\u2200y(P(x,y)). So, this means that there is some specific x that relates to every y in a way that P holds. On the other hand, the conclusion we want to reach is \u2200y\u2203x(P(x,y)), which means that for every y, there is at least one x that makes P true with that y. \n\nWait, so the original statement is saying that there's a single x that works for all y, and we need to show that this implies that for every y, there's some x (which might depend on y) that works. So, in other words, if there's a universal x that works for all y, then for each y individually, you can find an x (maybe the same one or a different one) that works. \n\nLet me think of an example to visualize this. Let's say P(x,y) is something like \"x is greater than y.\" So, \u2203x\u2200y(x > y) would mean that there's some number x that is greater than every y. Well, that's not possible because for any x you choose, there's always a y that's bigger, like y = x+1. So maybe that's not the best example. Maybe a better example is P(x,y) = \"x equals y.\" So, \u2203x\u2200y(x = y) would mean there's one specific x that is equal to every y, which again doesn't make sense because only one number can be equal to every other number, but that would mean all y are the same, which isn't necessarily the case. Hmm, maybe a better example is P(x,y) = \"x is less than or equal to y.\" So, \u2203x\u2200y(x \u2264 y) would mean there's an x that is a lower bound for all y.

Hmm, let's see. First, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the original set itself, right? So, if S has n elements, the total number of subsets would be 2^n because each element can be either included or excluded, giving 2 choices per element and hence 2 multiplied by itself n times.\n\nBut wait, the question is about proper subsets. So, if the total number of subsets is 2^n, then the number of proper subsets would be 2^n minus the number of subsets that are equal to S itself. How many subsets are equal to S? Well, only one subset, which is S itself. So, subtracting that, the number of proper subsets should be 2^n - 1. That makes sense.\n\nBut the question says \"for any non-empty set S with n elements,\" so I need to make sure this holds for any non-empty set. Maybe I can try with a small example to see if this works. Let's take S = {1}. Then, the subsets of S are the empty set and {1}. The proper subsets are just the empty set, so that's 1 subset. Plugging into the formula, 2^1 - 1 = 1, which matches. Good.\n\nLet me try another example. How about S = {1, 2}. The subsets are {}, {1}, {2}, and {1, 2}. The proper subsets are {}, {1}, {2}, so that's 3 subsets. Plugging into the formula, 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3, which also matches.\n\nAnother one: S = {1, 2, 3}. Subsets: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. Proper subsets are all except S itself, so 7 subsets. Using the formula, 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.

In this case, each term is multiplied by 2, so that checks out.\n\nAlright, so the general formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the number of terms. Wait, but in this problem, the last exponent is n-1, so maybe I need to adjust that. Let me think.\n\nHere, the first term 'a' is 1, and the common ratio 'r' is 2 because each term is 2 times the previous one. So plugging into the formula, the sum S should be (1*(2^n - 1))/(2 - 1), which simplifies to (2^n - 1)/1, so S = 2^n - 1. That matches the right side of the equation given in the problem. So, that seems straightforward. But wait, the problem says to use mathematical induction. Hmm, okay, so I can't just use the formula; I need to prove it by induction.\n\nAlright, let's remember how mathematical induction works. There are two steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the statement holds true for n=1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume it holds for some integer k, and then I show it holds for k+1.\n\nLet me start with the base case, n=1. So, plugging n=1 into the left side, the sum is just 1. On the right side, it's 2^1 - 1, which is also 1. So, 1=1, which is true. That checks out. So the base case is good.\n\nNow, let's move on to the inductive step.

So, in this case, no matter what P, Q, and R are, the entire statement should be true.\n\nThe statement is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2192 R). Let me break it down. It has two implications: P implies Q and Q implies R. The conjunction of these two implications is then implied by another implication, P implies R. So, if P implies Q and Q implies R, does that mean P implies R? That seems familiar. Isn't that called the transitive property of implication? So, if I have P implies Q and Q implies R, then by transitivity, P implies R. Therefore, the entire statement should be a tautology because it's always true.\n\nBut maybe I should approach this more formally. Let me write down the original statement symbolically. Let me denote the entire statement as S:\n\nS = (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) \u2192 (P \u2192 R)\n\nI need to show that S is a tautology. To do this, I can use a truth table, but since it's a four-variable statement, the truth table would have 16 rows, which is manageable. Alternatively, I can use logical equivalences to simplify S and show that it reduces to a known tautology.\n\nWait, another approach is to use natural deduction. Let me try that. In natural deduction, to prove that S is a tautology, I need to show that assuming P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 R, I can derive P \u2192 R.\n\nSo, let's start with assuming P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 R.

Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that in set theory, the distributive property is one of the axioms that holds for sets, but I also recall that this property is actually a result of other axioms or maybe derived from them.

Then, since x is also in A, x is in A \u2229 B. Therefore, x is in (A \u2229 B). \n\nCase 2: Suppose x is in C. Then, since x is also in A, x is in A \u2229 C.

Let me recall how that works. Cantor's diagonal argument is used to show that the real numbers are uncountable, but maybe I can use a similar idea here. Wait, actually, the rational numbers are countable, so this method should work for them. \n\nLet me try to outline the process. The idea is to enumerate all rational numbers by \"diagonalizing\" through a grid of integers. So, suppose I list all the rational numbers in a grid where the rows represent the numerator and the columns represent the denominator. But that might not be the most straightforward way because some numbers can be represented in multiple ways, like 1/2 is the same as 2/4 or 3/6, etc. Hmm, that could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a pairing function that maps each rational number to a unique natural number. A pairing function is a bijection between the set of natural numbers and pairs of natural numbers. A common example is the Cantor pairing function, which is defined as \u03c0(k, n) = (k + n)(n + 1)/2 + n. This function ensures that each pair (k, n) corresponds to a unique natural number. \n\nSo, if I can list all the rational numbers as ordered pairs (p, q) where p and q are integers, then I can use this pairing function to assign each pair a unique natural number. That should work, but I need to make sure that every rational number is covered. \n\nWait, but not every rational number can be written as a reduced fraction p/q where p and q are coprime.

The argument is: \"All mathematicians are logical. Some philosophers are mathematicians. Therefore, some philosophers are logical.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in symbolic logic, we use predicates to represent categories or groups. So, let's assign symbols to each part. Let me think: let M(x) denote \"x is a mathematician,\" P(x) for \"x is a philosopher,\" and L(x) for \"x is logical.\" \n\nNow, the first statement is \"All mathematicians are logical.\" In symbolic terms, that should be a universal statement. So, that would translate to \u2200x (M(x) \u2192 L(x)). That makes sense because it's saying every mathematician falls under the category of being logical.\n\nNext, the second statement is \"Some philosophers are mathematicians.\" That's an existential statement, so it would be \u2203x (P(x) \u2227 M(x)). So, there exists at least one philosopher who is also a mathematician.\n\nThe conclusion we need to reach is \"Some philosophers are logical.\" That's also existential, so it should be \u2203x (P(x) \u2227 L(x)). So, we need to see if the premises lead to this conclusion.\n\nTo figure out if the argument is valid, I should probably use some rules of inference. I think syllogism is the right approach here. Syllogism deals with categorical syllogisms, which are arguments with two premises and a conclusion, all of which are categorical statements.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a universal affirmative (\"All M are L\"), the second premise is an existential affirmative (\"Some P are M\"), and the conclusion is an existential affirmative (\"Some P are L\"). \n\nI recall that the valid syllogisms are called \"Darii\" when the conclusion is also affirmative. So, Darii has the form:\n\nAll M are L.\nSome P are M.\nTherefore, Some P are L.\n\nWhich is exactly the structure here. So, by the Darii rule, this syllogism is valid. That means the argument is logically sound.\n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think about the structure again.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, induction. I remember that mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually proving it for the initial value, often \\( n = 1 \\), and then assuming it's true for some integer \\( k \\) and proving it for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nSo, let me start with the base case. Let's take \\( n = 1 \\). Plugging into \\( n^3 - n \\), we get \\( 1^3 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \\). Now, does 6 divide 0? Well, yes, because any number divides 0. So, the base case holds. That\u2019s good.\n\nNow, the inductive step. Assume that for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), \\( 6 \\) divides \\( k^3 - k \\). So, \\( k^3 - k = 6m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). I need to show that \\( 6 \\) also divides \\( (k + 1)^3 - (k + 1) \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( (k + 1)^3 - (k + 1) \\). Expanding the cube, that's \\( (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) - k - 1 \\). Simplify that: \\( k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 - k - 1 \\). The constants 1 and -1 cancel out, so we have \\( k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k - k \\). Combine like terms: \\( k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k \\).\n\nFactor out a \\( k \\): \\( k(k^2 + 3k + 2) \\). Hmm, the quadratic can be factored further: \\( k(k + 1)(k + 2) \\).

Hmm, okay, let me break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, symbols like P and Q represent propositions, which can be either true or false. The symbols \u2228 stand for \"or\" and \u2227 stand for \"and.\" So, the statement is saying that either P is true or Q is true, and at the same time, both P is false and Q is false. Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory, doesn't it?\n\nLet me write it out: (P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2227 ~Q). So, breaking it down, the first part is (P \u2228 Q), which means either P is true, or Q is true, or maybe both. The second part is (~P \u2227 ~Q), which means P is false and Q is false. Now, how do these two parts interact?\n\nI think I need to use the distributive law here. The distributive law in logic states that (A \u2227 (B \u2228 C)) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C). But wait, in this case, it's (P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2227 ~Q). Maybe I can distribute the \u2227 over the \u2228? Let me see.\n\nSo, applying the distributive law: (P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2227 ~Q) becomes (P \u2227 ~P) \u2228 (Q \u2227 ~Q). Hmm, okay, so now I have two parts: P \u2227 ~P and Q \u2227 ~Q. I remember that P \u2227 ~P is a contradiction, right? Because if P is true, ~P is false, and vice versa. So, P \u2227 ~P is always false. Similarly, Q \u2227 ~Q is also a contradiction, so that's also always false.\n\nSo, both (P \u2227 ~P) and (Q \u2227 ~Q) are always false. Then, (P \u2227 ~P) \u2228 (Q \u2227 ~Q) is the disjunction of two false statements. I recall that in logic, OR with two false statements is also false. Because OR requires at least one of the statements to be true to be true itself. If both are false, the whole statement is false.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together: (P \u2228 Q", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": [], "btk_llm": ["But wait, in this case, it's (P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2227 ~Q)."], "btk_manual": ["But wait, in this case, it's (P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2227 ~Q)."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_45", "task_problem": "Prove that for any sets A and B, |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|, where |X| represents the cardinality of set X.", "task_answer": "Okay, so I need to prove that for any two sets A and B, the cardinality of their union is equal to the sum of their cardinalities minus the cardinality of their intersection. That is, |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. Hmm, I remember this is called the inclusion-exclusion principle. But I need to actually prove it, not just state it.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use a proof by example or maybe a more formal approach. Since it's about cardinality, which is a number of elements, I can think in terms of counting elements in A and B.\n\nLet me recall that the union of two sets A and B, denoted A \u222a B, consists of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. So, if I want to count the number of elements in A \u222a B, I can count all the elements in A and all the elements in B, but then I have to subtract the elements that are in both A and B because those are counted twice when I add |A| and |B|. That makes sense intuitively.\n\nLet me try to formalize this idea. Suppose I have two finite sets A and B. Let\u2019s denote the elements of A as a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099 and elements of B as b\u2081, b\u2082, ..., b\u2098. Then the union A \u222a B will have elements which are either in A or in B or in both. So, if I just add the number of elements in A and B, I will be counting the elements that are in both twice. Therefore, to get the correct count, I need to subtract the number of elements in both once.\n\nSo, if I write this out, |A| is n, |B| is m, and |A \u2229 B| is the number of common elements, say k. Then, |A| + |B| would be n + m, but since k elements are counted twice, I subtract k to get the correct total, which is n + m - k. Therefore, |A \u222a B| = n + m - k, which is |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. Hmm, that seems to work for finite sets.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify that A and B are finite.

But I need to actually prove it, not just state it.\n\nLet me start by recalling what each side means. \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) means \"not both P and Q,\" right? So if P is true and Q is true, then \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) is false. But if either P is false or Q is false, then \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) is true. On the other hand, \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ is \"either not P or not Q.\" So if either P is false or Q is false, then \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ is true. If both P and Q are true, then both \u00acP and \u00acQ are false, so \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ is false. Wait a second, that seems exactly like \u00ac(P \u2227 Q). So they behave the same way in all possible truth values. So maybe that's why they are equivalent.\n\nBut I should make this more formal. Maybe I can use a truth table to compare both sides. Let me try that. There are four possible combinations for P and Q: both true, P true and Q false, P false and Q true, and both false.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\n1. P | Q | P \u2227 Q | \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) | \u00acP | \u00acQ | \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ\n   |---|-------|---------|---------|-----|-----|---------\n   | T | T | T | F | F | F | T\n   | T | F | F | T | T | F | T\n   | F | T | F | T | F | T | T\n   | F | F | F | T | T | T | T\n\nLooking at the columns, in each row, the values for \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) and \u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ are the same.

And real numbers include all the rational and irrational numbers. So, the statement is saying that no matter which two real numbers you pick, there's always at least one rational number in between them. That seems intuitive, but how do I prove it?\n\nMaybe I can use the density of rational numbers. I think density means that between any two numbers, no matter how close they are, there's a rational number. So, if I can show that the rationals are dense in the real numbers, that would do it. But how do I formally prove that?\n\nLet me recall the definition of density. A set S is dense in the real numbers if every real number is either in S or is a limit point of S. But maybe I don't need that. Maybe I can use the Archimedean property or something related. Wait, the Archimedean property says that for any real number, there's a rational number between it and 0, right? Or is it between any two real numbers?

Hmm, induction is usually done in two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start by recalling what both of those mean.\n\nFirst, the base case. For n = 4, I need to check if 4! is indeed greater than 2^4. Let me calculate that. 4! is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 24. And 2^4 is 16. So, 24 > 16, which is true. So, the base case holds. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. Here, I assume that the statement is true for some integer k \u2265 4, meaning that k! > 2^k. Then, I need to show that (k+1)! > 2^(k+1). \n\nLet me write down the assumption: k! > 2^k. Now, (k+1)! is equal to (k+1) \u00d7 k!. So, substituting the inductive hypothesis, that would be (k+1) \u00d7 2^k. So, (k+1)! = (k+1) \u00d7 k!.\n\nTherefore, I need to show that (k+1) \u00d7 k! > 2^(k+1). Since k! > 2^k, then multiplying both sides by (k+1) gives (k+1) \u00d7 k! > (k+1) \u00d7 2^k. So, I have (k+1)! > (k+1) \u00d7 2^k.\n\nNow, I need to compare (k+1) \u00d7 2^k with 2^(k+1).

So, for example, if X is {1, 2}, then P(X) is {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}. Got that.\n\nNow, the problem says if A is a subset of B, then P(A) is a subset of P(B).

That is, if I have a subset C of A, then C is also a subset of B. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. P(A) is the set of all subsets of A, and P(B) is the set of all subsets of B. If A is a subset of B, then any subset of A is also a subset of B. Because if C is a subset of A, then all elements of C are in A, and since A is in B, all elements of C are also in B. So, C is a subset of B. Therefore, every element of P(A) is an element of P(B), which means P(A) is a subset of P(B). That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me try to structure this more formally. So, to prove that P(A) is a subset of P(B), I need to show that for every subset C of A, C is also a subset of B. Since A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. So, if C is a subset of A, then every element of C is in A, and since A is a subset of B, every element of C is also in B.

It's like \"If P, then Q.\" So, in this case, P is \"it rains\" and Q is \"the ground is wet.\" \n\nNow, the contrapositive of an implication is formed by switching the order and negating both parts. So, the contrapositive would be \"If not Q, then not P.\" That means if the ground is not wet, then it does not rain. That makes sense because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nNext, the converse. The converse flips the original statement, so it would be \"If the ground is wet, then it rains.\" Wait, is that right? Yeah, because you switch P and Q. So, if the ground is wet, then it must have rained. But hold on, is that necessarily true? I mean, someone could have just spilled water, so the ground might be wet without it raining. Hmm, so the converse isn't necessarily true, but that's okay because the original statement doesn't say anything about the converse.\n\nThen, the inverse. The inverse is formed by negating both parts and keeping the order the same. So, that would be \"If it does not rain, then the ground is not wet.\" Hmm, that doesn't seem right. If it doesn't rain, does that mean the ground isn't wet? Not necessarily. The ground could be wet for other reasons, like someone watering the lawn or a sprinkler. So, the inverse isn't true either.\n\nLet me double-check the contrapositive. If the ground is not wet, then it doesn't rain. That seems correct because if it didn't rain, the ground wouldn't be wet, unless maybe it's a very wet place, but generally, no rain would mean the ground isn't wet. So, the contrapositive is true, which aligns with the original statement.\n\nTo visualize this, maybe I can draw a truth table or something. Let me think. The original statement is P \u2192 Q. The contrapositive is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. It says that if n is a positive integer and n is divisible by 3, then n squared must also be divisible by 3. So, in other words, if 3 divides n, then 3 should also divide n\u00b2. That makes sense because 3 is a prime number, right? I remember that prime numbers have special properties when it comes to divisibility. \n\nWait, actually, let me recall. If a prime number divides a product, it must divide at least one of the factors. That's Euclid's lemma, isn't it? So, if 3 divides n times n, which is n\u00b2, then 3 must divide n or 3 must divide n. But n is already divisible by 3, so that works out. Hmm, maybe that's the way to go. \n\nBut let me think through it more carefully. Maybe I should write down what it means for a number to be divisible by 3. If n is divisible by 3, that means there exists some integer k such that n = 3k. So, n = 3k for some integer k. Then, n squared would be (3k) squared, which is 9k squared. Since 9 is obviously divisible by 3, and k squared is an integer, then 9k squared must also be divisible by 3. \n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but let me make sure I haven't missed anything. So, n is divisible by 3, so n = 3k. Then n\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2.

The argument is: If I go to the mall, I buy new shoes. I did not buy new shoes. Therefore, I did not go to the mall. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, this sounds like a conditional statement. The structure is \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"I go to the mall,\" and Q is \"I buy new shoes.\" So the first statement is P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe second premise is \u00acQ, which is \"I did not buy new shoes.\" So we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ. The conclusion is \u00acP, which is \"I did not go to the mall.\"\n\nI think this is a classic example of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens. From what I recall, modus tollens is a rule that says if we have a conditional statement and its negation, we can infer the negation of the antecedent. So, if P \u2192 Q is true and \u00acQ is true, then \u00acP must be true. That seems to fit here.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Sometimes I get confused with modus tollens and modus tollendo. Modus tollens is about denying the consequent, right? So if P \u2192 Q, and we know Q is false, then P must be false. Yeah, that makes sense. If I didn't buy new shoes (\u00acQ), then I didn't go to the mall (\u00acP). So the conclusion follows logically.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where this might not hold. For example, what if I went to the mall but didn't buy shoes? Does that mean I didn't go? Well, in this context, the statement is a general rule, so if you go to the mall, it's implied that you buy shoes there. So if you didn't buy them, it logically follows that you didn't go. \n\nWait, but could there be other reasons for not buying shoes? Maybe I went to the mall but didn't buy shoes because I didn't have money or something. But the original statement doesn't specify any exceptions. It's a straightforward conditional.

But real numbers are more than that\u2014they include all the fractions, decimals, irrationals, and so on. So, I think Georg Cantor proved this using a diagonal argument. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I know that if a set is countable, it means we can list its elements in a sequence like a1, a2, a3, and so on, just like the natural numbers. So, for the real numbers to be countable, we should be able to list them all in a sequence. But I have a feeling that's not possible because there are just so many real numbers between any two numbers, right? Like between 0 and 1, there are infinitely many decimals.\n\nMaybe I can use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the real numbers are countable. Then, we can list them as r1, r2, r3, and so on. Each real number can be expressed as a decimal, so each ri can be written as a decimal expansion. For example, r1 = a11a12a13..., r2 = b11b12b13..., and so on.\n\nNow, I need to construct a real number that's not in this list. Let me think. If I take the decimal expansion where each digit is different from the corresponding digit in each real number in the list. So, for the first digit after the decimal, I'll choose a digit different from a11, a12, a13, etc. Then, for the second digit, choose a digit different from b11, b12, etc., and so on. But wait, I have to make sure that this process works for all digits.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let\u2019s denote the real numbers as r1, r2, r3, ..., and each ri = ai1 ai2 ai3 ... where ai are digits (0-9).

So, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to \u00ac(P \u2227 Q). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I have \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, that's the same as saying if not P, then not Q.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, primes are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. The statement I need to prove is that there is no largest prime number. That means, no matter how big a prime number you have, there's always a bigger one.\n\nSo, how do I use proof by contradiction here? Well, proof by contradiction assumes that the opposite of what we want is true and then shows that this leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I should assume that there is a largest prime number and then show that this assumption leads to something impossible.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAssume that there exists a largest prime number, let's call it P. So, P is prime, and there is no prime number larger than P.\n\nNow, if P is the largest prime, then all primes are less than or equal to P. But wait, isn't P itself a prime? So, if I add 1 to P, I get P + 1. Now, I need to think about whether P + 1 is prime or not.\n\nHmm, P is prime, so it's only divisible by 1 and itself. But P + 1 is one more than a prime. Is P + 1 necessarily prime? I don't think so. For example, if P is 2, then P + 1 is 3, which is prime. If P is 3, P + 1 is 4, which is not prime. If P is 5, P + 1 is 6, which is not prime. So, sometimes P + 1 is prime, sometimes not.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since we don't know what P is, it could be that P + 1 is prime or not. So, maybe that's not the direction to go. Let me think differently.\n\nI remember that in number theory, there's a concept called Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes. Maybe I can use a similar approach.

An odd number, on the other hand, is an integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, such as 1, 3, 5, etc. So, every number is either even or odd, but not both. \n\nWait, but how do I show that?

It states that for any integer \\( n \\) and positive integer \\( d \\), there exist unique integers \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) such that \\( n = dq + r \\) where \\( 0 \\leq r < d \\). In this case, if I let \\( d = 2 \\), then the equation becomes \\( n = 2q + r \\), where \\( r \\) is either 0 or 1 because those are the only possible remainders when dividing by 2.\n\nSo, if \\( r = 0 \\), then \\( n \\) is even because it can be expressed as \\( 2q \\). If \\( r = 1 \\), then \\( n \\) is odd because it's \\( 2q + 1 \\). Since \\( r \\) can't be anything else, \\( n \\) must be either even or odd. \n\nBut wait, can it be both? Let's think. Suppose \\( n \\) is even, which means \\( n = 2q \\). If I try to express it as \\( 2q' + 1 \\), then \\( n = 2q' + 1 \\). But that would mean \\( 2q = 2q' + 1 \\), which implies \\( 2(q - q') = 1 \\). That can't be true because 2 times any integer is even, and 1 is odd. So, there's a contradiction.

So, it's an implication where the antecedent is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 P, and the consequent is Q. I need to simplify this expression using logical equivalences.\n\nI recall that implications can be rewritten using disjunctions. Specifically, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. Maybe I can apply this first. Let me rewrite the inner part: P \u2192 Q is \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, the antecedent of the main implication becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 P.\n\nNow, I have (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 P. I think I can distribute the conjunction over the disjunction here. Wait, is that a valid step? I remember that \u2227 distributes over \u2228, so (A \u2228 B) \u2227 C is equivalent to (A \u2227 C) \u2228 (B \u2227 C). Applying that here, it becomes (\u00acP \u2227 P) \u2228 (Q \u2227 P). Hmm, but \u00acP \u2227 P is a contradiction, right? Because if P is true, \u00acP is false, and vice versa. So \u00acP \u2227 P is always false. So that part is just false, and the other part is Q \u2227 P.\n\nSo, (\u00acP \u2227 P) \u2228 (Q \u2227 P) simplifies to false \u2228 (Q \u2227 P).

On the other hand, (A - B) is all elements in A not in B, and (A - C) is all elements in A not in C.

So, x is in A, and x is not in B and x is not in C. \n\nTherefore, x is in A - B because x is in A and not in B, and x is in A - C because x is in A and not in C.

It says that for any positive integer n, when you take n squared and add n to it, the result is even. So, n\u00b2 + n should be even. Hmm, okay. I remember that even and odd numbers have specific properties, so maybe I can use that here.\n\nLet me recall, an even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. An odd number, on the other hand, when divided by 2, leaves a remainder of 1. So, if I can show that n\u00b2 + n is divisible by 2, then it's even. Alternatively, if I can show that n\u00b2 + n leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, then it's even.\n\nMaybe I can use modular arithmetic here. I remember that in modular arithmetic, numbers wrap around after reaching a certain value, the modulus. So, modulo 2, the possible remainders are 0 and 1.

That might be a good approach because every integer is either even or odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even. If n is even, then n is divisible by 2, which means n = 2k for some integer k. Let me substitute that into n\u00b2 + n. So, n\u00b2 + n = (2k)\u00b2 + 2k = 4k\u00b2 + 2k. Now, both terms here, 4k\u00b2 and 2k, are clearly divisible by 2 because 4k\u00b2 is 2*(2k\u00b2) and 2k is 2*k. So, adding them together, we have 2*(2k\u00b2 + k), which is clearly divisible by 2. Therefore, n\u00b2 + n is even when n is even.\n\nCase 2: n is odd. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Let me plug that into n\u00b2 + n.

The subject here is \"every real number,\" which in first-order logic would be translated using the universal quantifier for all. So that part should be straightforward.\n\nNext, the statement says \"has an additive inverse.\" I need to define what an additive inverse is. An additive inverse of a number 'a' is a number 'b' such that when you add them together, you get zero. So, in mathematical terms, b = -a. Therefore, the predicate here would be something like \"is_additive_inverse(x, y),\" where x is the number and y is its inverse.\n\nPutting that together, the statement \"Every real number has an additive inverse\" would translate to a universal statement for all real numbers x, such that there exists a y where y is the additive inverse of x.

The additive inverse is such that x + y = 0, so y is the inverse of x. So in the predicate, x is the original number and y is its inverse. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. For each real number x, there exists a real number y where y is the additive inverse of x. Yeah, that sounds right. So the translation would be \u2200x\u2208\u211d, \u2203y\u2208\u211d, is_additive_inverse(x, y). \n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here.

The second premise is \"I study,\" which is P. So the conclusion is \"I will not fail the exam,\" which is \u00acQ.\n\nSo the argument is: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, P, therefore \u00acQ. Hmm, that seems a bit off. Wait, no, actually, the first statement is \"If I do not study, then I will fail the exam,\" which is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. Then the second premise is P, meaning I do study. So the conclusion is \u00acQ, meaning I will not fail.\n\nWait, so if I rephrase the syllogism, it's like: If not P, then not Q. P. Therefore, not Q. So in logical terms, this would be: (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), P, therefore \u00acQ. Is this a valid syllogism? \n\nI think this is an example of a logical fallacy. Let me recall the rules of syllogisms. The major premise is the first statement, the minor premise is the second statement, and the conclusion is the third. So major premise: If not P, then not Q. Minor premise: P. Conclusion: Not Q.\n\nWait, but in syllogistic logic, the conclusion must follow from the premises. Let me check the validity.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about even and odd numbers, maybe I can use that. \n\nFirst, let me recall what consecutive integers are. Consecutive integers are numbers that come one after the other without any gaps. Like 3 and 4, or 5 and 6. So, if I take two such numbers, say n and n+1, their product would be n multiplied by n+1, right? So, I need to show that n(n+1) is always even.\n\nHmm, how do I show something is always even? Well, I remember that an even number is any integer divisible by 2. So, if I can show that either n or n+1 is divisible by 2, then their product will definitely be even because multiplying by 2 will give an even number. \n\nWait, is that always the case? Let me think. If n is even, then n is divisible by 2, so n(n+1) would be even. If n is odd, then n+1 must be even because adding 1 to an odd number makes it even. So, regardless of whether n is even or odd, one of the two numbers must be even. Therefore, their product should always be even. \n\nLet me test this with some examples to make sure I'm on the right track. \n\nTake n=2: 2*3=6, which is even. Okay, that works.\n\nAnother example: n=3. 3*4=12, which is even. Good.\n\nHow about n=4: 4*5=20, also even. Hmm, seems consistent.\n\nWhat about negative numbers? Let's try n=-1: (-1)*0=0, which is even. Hmm, zero is even, right? Yes, because it's divisible by 2.\n\nAnother negative example: n=-2: (-2)*(-1)=2, which is even. Yeah, that still works.\n\nWait, does this hold for all integers, positive, negative, and zero? Let's see. If n=0, then 0*1=0, which is even. If n=1, 1*2=2, even. If n=2, 2*3=6, even.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of these terms means. A set A is a subset of B, which is written as A \u2286 B, if every element in A is also in B. That means if I pick any element from A, it must also be in B. So, for example, if A has elements like {1, 2, 3}, and B has elements {1, 2, 3, 4}, then A is a subset of B because all elements in A are in B.\n\nNow, the intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A \u2229 B, is the set containing all elements that are both in A and in B. So, using the example above, A \u2229 B would be {1, 2, 3} because those are the elements common to both A and B.\n\nThe statement to prove is that if A is a subset of B, then A \u2229 B equals A. So, in other words, when A is entirely contained within B, their intersection should just be A itself. That makes sense intuitively because if all elements of A are already in B, then the overlap between A and B is just A.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. To show that two sets are equal, I need to show that each set is a subset of the other. So, I need to show two things: first, that A is a subset of A \u2229 B, and second, that A \u2229 B is a subset of A.\n\nStarting with the first part: Is A a subset of A \u2229 B? Well, by definition, A \u2229 B contains all elements that are in both A and B. Since A is a subset of B, every element in A is in B. Therefore, every element in A must also be in A \u2229 B because if they are in A and in B, they are in the intersection.

The question is whether this is a tautology. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what a tautology is first. If I remember correctly, a tautology in logic is a statement that is always true, no matter what truth values its propositional variables take. So, it's something that can't be false. \n\nAlright, so the statement given is ((P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R)) \u2192 (P \u2192 R). Let me parse this step by step. It looks like a conditional statement where the antecedent is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) and the consequent is (P \u2192 R). So, in plain English, it's saying that if (P implies Q) and (Q implies R), then (P implies R). \n\nI think this might be related to something like the transitive property in logic. Like, if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P should imply R. That does make sense intuitively because if P can get you to Q and Q can get you to R, then P should be able to get you to R. So, maybe this is a known logical truth.\n\nBut let me not jump to conclusions. Let me break it down more carefully. Maybe I can use truth tables to verify this. Since it's a proposition with three propositional variables, P, Q, and R, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values. So, if I make a truth table, I can check each case and see if the statement is always true.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. P is true, Q is true, R is true.\n2.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. I remember that in logic, when you have quantifiers, sometimes you can move them around or change their order under certain conditions. But I need to be careful because moving quantifiers can sometimes change the meaning if not done properly.\n\nFirst, let me recall what these statements mean. The original statement is \"There exists an x such that P(x) or Q(x) holds.\" The other statement is \"There exists an x such that P(x) holds, or there exists an x such that Q(x) holds.\" At first glance, these seem similar, but I need to verify if they are logically equivalent.\n\nLet me consider the left side: \u2203x(P(x) \u2228 Q(x)). This means that there is some specific x for which either P(x) is true or Q(x) is true, or maybe both. The right side is \u2203xP(x) \u2228 \u2203xQ(x), which means that either there is some x that makes P(x) true, or there is some x that makes Q(x) true. So, the only difference is the scope of the quantifiers and the structure of the disjunction.\n\nWait, actually, in the first case, the disjunction is inside the existential quantifier, so it's saying that there is an x that satisfies either P or Q. In the second case, it's saying that either there exists an x that satisfies P or there exists an x that satisfies Q. So, maybe these are actually not equivalent because the first one is about a single x making either P or Q true, while the second is about two separate x's, one making P true and another making Q true.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think about it with an example. Suppose P(x) is \"x is a dog\" and Q(x) is \"x is a cat.\" So, \u2203x(P(x) \u2228 Q(x)) would mean \"There exists an animal that is either a dog or a cat.\" That's obviously true because there are dogs and cats.

Hmm, induction, right? Let me recall how mathematical induction works. There are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case. That usually means plugging in the smallest positive integer, which is 1. So, let's see what 4^1 - 1 is. That's 4 - 1, which equals 3. Is 3 divisible by 3? Yes, because 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the base case checks out.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that 4^k - 1 is divisible by 3. Then, I have to show that the statement holds for k + 1, which would be 4^(k+1) - 1. \n\nAlright, let's write down the inductive hypothesis: 4^k - 1 is divisible by 3. So, that means 4^k - 1 = 3m for some integer m. Now, I need to express 4^(k+1) - 1 in terms of 4^k to use the inductive hypothesis. \n\nI know that 4^(k+1) is the same as 4 * 4^k.

The even natural numbers would be 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. \n\nSo, the question is about cardinality, which means the size of the set in terms of how many elements are in it. If two sets have the same cardinality, that means there's a one-to-one correspondence between them, meaning each element in one set can be paired with an element in the other set without any overlaps or omissions.\n\nLet me recall, the set of natural numbers, N, is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} and the set of even natural numbers, which I can denote as E, is {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}. So, is there a way to map each natural number to an even natural number uniquely?\n\nHmm, maybe I can think about division. If I take any natural number n, I can divide it by 2, and if it's even, then n/2 is an integer, which would be an element of E.

Let me rewrite that first.\n\nSo, P \u2192 (Q \u2192 R) becomes \u00acP \u2228 (\u00acQ \u2228 R). Because Q \u2192 R is \u00acQ \u2228 R, so substituting that in, we have \u00acP \u2228 (\u00acQ \u2228 R). Now, associativity of \u2228 allows me to rearrange this a bit.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down what it means for n\u00b2 to be divisible by 4. If n\u00b2 is divisible by 4, that means when you divide n squared by 4, there's no remainder. In mathematical terms, 4 divides n\u00b2, which can be written as 4 | n\u00b2. I need to show that this implies that 2 divides n, or in other words, n is even.\n\nI remember that if a number is divisible by 4, then its square root might have some properties related to divisibility by 2. But wait, is that always true? Let me test with some examples.\n\nTake n = 2. Then n\u00b2 = 4, which is divisible by 4, and n is divisible by 2. Okay, that works. How about n = 4? n\u00b2 = 16, which is also divisible by 4, and n is divisible by 2. That works too. Let's try n = 6. n\u00b2 = 36, which is divisible by 4?

Hmm, okay, that seems consistent.\n\nWhat about n = 1? n\u00b2 = 1, which isn't divisible by 4, so that doesn't apply. n = 3, n\u00b2 = 9, also not divisible by 4. So, it seems like only even numbers have squares divisible by 4. Maybe that's the case.\n\nSo, perhaps I should approach this with prime factorization. Let me recall that any integer n can be expressed as n = 2^k * m, where m is an odd integer. Since n is a positive integer, k can be 0 or more, and m is odd, meaning m is not divisible by 2.\n\nSo, if I square n, I get n\u00b2 = (2^k * m)^2 = 2^(2k) * m\u00b2.

The base case is where you show that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step is where you assume it holds for some arbitrary natural number k and then prove it for k+1.\n\nSo, let's start with the base case. For n=1, the first odd natural number is just 1. The sum of the first 1 odd natural number is 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1=1, which means the base case works. That wasn't too bad.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, I assume that the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. So, mathematically, that's:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2.\n\nAlright, now I need to show that if this is true, then the statement should also hold for k+1. That is, the sum of the first k+1 odd natural numbers should be (k+1) squared. So, that would be:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1) = (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nSince I know the sum up to k is k\u00b2, I can substitute that in. So, the left side becomes k\u00b2 + (2k+1). So, I have:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute the right side. (k + 1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.

So, if I let the odd integer be 2n + 1, then its square would be (2n + 1)^2.\n\nLet me compute that: (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1. Hmm, okay. Now, I have 4n^2 + 4n + 1. I need to express this in the form 8k + 1. So, maybe I can factor out something from the first two terms.\n\nLooking at 4n^2 + 4n, I can factor out a 4, which gives me 4(n^2 + n) + 1. So, now we have 4(n^2 + n) + 1. Hmm, can I write n^2 + n as something times something else? Maybe factor it further or find a way to express it in terms of another variable.\n\nWait, n^2 + n is equal to n(n + 1). So, substituting that back in, we have 4n(n + 1) + 1. Now, n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, right? So, one of them must be even because every two consecutive numbers include one even and one odd. That means n(n + 1) is the product of an even number, which is divisible by 2.\n\nBut I need to get to 8k, which is divisible by 8. So, n(n + 1) must be divisible by 8? Or at least, when multiplied by 4, it becomes divisible by 16? Wait, let's see. Let me think step by step.\n\nSince n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, so n(n + 1) is divisible by 2. But is it divisible by 4? Let's check with some examples.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, when we have statements with quantifiers, the order of the quantifiers can sometimes change the meaning. So, I should probably recall some basic logic rules or maybe some examples to test this out.\n\nLet me write down both statements:\n\n1. \u2200x\u2203y(P(x) \u2192 Q(y))\n2. \u2203y\u2200x(P(x) \u2192 Q(y))\n\nSo, the first one is a universal quantifier followed by an existential quantifier, and the second one is an existential quantifier followed by a universal quantifier. I think these are called \"swapped\" or \"reversed\" quantifiers. I remember that sometimes they can have different meanings, but I'm not entirely sure in all cases.\n\nLet me think about what these statements mean in English. The first one, \u2200x\u2203y(P(x) \u2192 Q(y)), translates to \"For every x, there exists a y such that if P(x) then Q(y).\" So, for each x, we can find some y that relates to it. The implication P(x) \u2192 Q(y) suggests that whenever P(x) is true, then Q(y) must also be true. But since y is dependent on x, does that mean that for each x, there's a specific y that works? Or maybe not necessarily specific, but just some y that works for that x?\n\nOn the other hand, the second statement \u2203y\u2200x(P(x) \u2192 Q(y)) translates to \"There exists a y such that for all x, if P(x) then Q(y).\" So here, instead of having a different y for each x, there is a single y that works for all x. That seems quite different. So in this case, no matter what x you pick, the same y must satisfy Q(y). \n\nWait, so in the first case, for each x, you can find a y that works, but y might be different for different x's. In the second case, it's the same y that works for all x's. That makes me think that these statements are not equivalent because the y's are scoped differently.\n\n", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["But since y is dependent on x, does that mean that for each x, there's a specific y that works?", "Wait, so in the first case, for each x, you can find a y that works, but y might be different for different x's."], "btk_llm": [], "btk_manual": ["But since y is dependent on x, does that mean that for each x, there's a specific y that works?", "Wait, so in the first case, for each x, you can find a y that works, but y might be different for different x's."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_74", "task_problem": "Prove by contradiction that \u221a3 is irrational.", "task_answer": "Okay, so I need to prove that \u221a3 is irrational. Hmm, I remember that a number is irrational if it cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if I can show that \u221a3 can't be written as a simple fraction, then it must be irrational. I think I should use proof by contradiction, which means I'll assume the opposite and then show that it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlright, let me start by assuming the opposite of what I want to prove. That means I'll assume that \u221a3 is rational. If \u221a3 is rational, then it can be written as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b is not zero. So, let's write that down:\n\n\u221a3 = a/b\n\nWhere a and b are integers, and the fraction is in its lowest terms, meaning the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is 1.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation, I get:\n\n(\u221a3)\u00b2 = (a/b)\u00b2\n3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2\n\nSo, 3b\u00b2 equals a squared. That means a\u00b2 is equal to 3 times b squared. Therefore, a\u00b2 is divisible by 3. If a\u00b2 is divisible by 3, then a must also be divisible by 3. Why? Because if 3 divides a\u00b2, then 3 must divide a. I remember that from number theory\u2014since 3 is prime, if it divides a product, it must divide at least one of the factors. Here, a\u00b2 is a product of a and a, so 3 must divide a. So, a is divisible by 3. Let's write that as:\n\na = 3k, where k is some integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, we get:\n\n3b\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2\n3b\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nb\u00b2 = 3k\u00b2\n\nSo, similar to before, if b\u00b2 is equal to 3k\u00b2, then b\u00b2 is divisible by 3. Therefore, b must also be divisible by 3.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what union and intersection mean. The union of two sets A and B, denoted as A \u222a B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. On the other hand, the intersection of A and B, denoted as A \u2229 B, is the set of all elements that are in both A and B. So, for this problem, I need to consider A \u222a \u2205 and A \u2229 \u2205.\n\nLet me start with A \u222a \u2205. The empty set, \u2205, has no elements in it. So, when I take the union of A and \u2205, I'm essentially combining all elements that are in A with nothing. That should just give me A because there are no additional elements from the empty set to add. So, A \u222a \u2205 should be equal to A.\n\nNow, for the intersection part, A \u2229 \u2205. The intersection of A and \u2205 would be all elements that are in both A and \u2205. But since \u2205 has no elements, there are no elements common to both A and \u2205. Therefore, the intersection should be the empty set itself.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe I should think about the definitions more formally. In set theory, the union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set. If one of the sets is empty, then all elements come from the other set. So, A \u222a \u2205 would just be A.\n\nSimilarly, the intersection of two sets is the set of elements common to both. If one set is empty, there are no elements common to both, so A \u2229 \u2205 must be empty.\n\nIs there a more formal way to prove this? Maybe using the axioms of set theory or Venn diagrams?\n\nFor the union: I remember that one of the axioms in set theory is that the union of a set with the empty set is the set itself.

I remember something about divisibility and squares, but I need to figure out if this specific statement is always true or if there are exceptions.\n\nFirst, let me rephrase the statement to make sure I understand it correctly. It says that if n squared is divisible by 3, then n itself must be divisible by 3. So, in mathematical terms, if 3 divides n\u00b2, then 3 divides n. I need to determine whether this is always true or if there are cases where n\u00b2 is divisible by 3 but n isn't.\n\nI think a good starting point is to recall some number theory concepts. I remember that if a prime number divides a square of another number, then the prime must also divide that number. Is that always the case? Wait, isn't that a theorem? Let me see... Yeah, I think it's called Euclid's lemma. It states that if a prime number divides the product of two integers, it must divide at least one of them. But in this case, we have a square, which is just one number multiplied by itself. So, if 3 divides n\u00b2, then 3 must divide n. That seems to fit. So, by that logic, the statement should be true.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me test it with some examples. Let's take n = 3. Then n\u00b2 = 9, which is divisible by 3, and n is also divisible by 3. That works. How about n = 6? n\u00b2 is 36, which is divisible by 3, and n is 6, which is also divisible by 3. Good.\n\nWhat if n is not divisible by 3? For example, n = 4. Then n\u00b2 is 16, which is not divisible by 3. So, in this case, the statement's condition isn't met because 16 isn't divisible by 3, so it doesn't violate the statement. How about n = 5? 5 squared is 25, which isn't divisible by 3 either. So, again, the condition isn't met.\n\nWait, but what if n is a multiple of", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["Wait, isn't that a theorem?", "But in this case, we have a square, which is just one number multiplied by itself.", "But just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me test it with some examples."], "btk_llm": [], "btk_manual": ["Wait, isn't that a theorem?", "But in this case, we have a square, which is just one number multiplied by itself.", "But just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me test it with some examples."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_79", "task_problem": "Prove that for any sets A, B, and C, (A - B) \u2229 C = (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C).", "task_answer": "Okay, so I need to prove that for any sets A, B, and C, the set difference (A - B) \u2229 C is equal to (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that set operations can sometimes be tricky, but if I break them down, they become manageable. Let me recall the definitions:\n\n- A - B is the set of elements in A that are not in B. So, (A - B) \u2229 C would be the elements that are in A but not in B, and also in C. On the other hand, (A \u2229 C) is the set of elements common to both A and C, and (B \u2229 C) is the set of elements common to both B and C. So, (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C) would be the elements that are in both A and C but not in B and C.\n\nWait, so both sides are trying to find elements that are in A and C but not in B. Maybe they are equal? Let me test this with some examples.\n\nSuppose A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 5}, and C = {4, 5, 6}. Let's compute both sides.\n\nFirst, (A - B) \u2229 C. A - B would be {1, 2} because those are the elements in A not in B. Then, intersecting this with C, which is {4, 5, 6}, so {1, 2} \u2229 {4, 5, 6} is empty set. So, (A - B) \u2229 C = \u2205.\n\nNow, let's compute (A \u2229 C) - (B \u2229 C). A \u2229 C is {4}, since 4 is the only element common to both A and C. B \u2229 C is {4, 5}, since both B and C have 4 and 5. So, {4} - {4,5} is {4} without 5, which is still {4}. But wait, that's not equal to the empty set. Hmm, that's a problem.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what these terms mean. A relation on a set is transitive if whenever it relates two elements, it also relates the result of applying it to those elements to a third one. In other words, if a relation R is transitive, then for all a, b, c in the set, if a R b and b R c, then a R c. On the other hand, a relation is symmetric if whenever a R b, then b R a. So, for symmetry, if a is related to b, then b must be related to a.\n\nNow, the relation in question is \"is divisible by.\" So, let's define it properly. For integers a and b, we can say that a is divisible by b if there exists an integer k such that a = b * k. So, a R b means there exists an integer k with a = b * k.\n\nAlright, so first, let's check if this relation is transitive. Let's take two integers a, b, c. Suppose a is divisible by b, so a = b * k for some integer k, and b is divisible by c, so b = c * m for some integer m. Then, can we say that a is divisible by c? Let's see: a = b * k = (c * m) * k = c * (m * k). So, a is equal to c multiplied by (m * k), which means a is divisible by c. Therefore, a R c, so the relation is transitive. That seems to check out.\n\nNext, is the relation symmetric? Let's see. Suppose a is divisible by b, so a = b * k for some integer k. Does that necessarily mean that b is divisible by a? Well, not necessarily. For example, let's take a = 6 and b = 3. Then 6 is divisible by 3 because 6 = 3 * 2. But 3 is not divisible by 6 because there's no integer k such that 3 = 6 * k. Since 6 * k is either 0 or a multiple of 6, and 3 isn't either, it's not divisible.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in logic, proving equivalence means showing that both sides have the same truth value in all possible scenarios. I can do this by constructing a truth table or by using logical equivalences. Maybe I'll try both methods to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic logical equivalences. I know that the implication P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, if I take the negation of both sides, \u00ac(P \u2192 Q) would be \u00ac(\u00acP \u2228 Q). Applying De Morgan's Law, that would become P \u2227 \u00acQ. Oh, so that directly gives me the equivalence! So, \u00ac(P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to P \u2227 \u00acQ. That seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check by constructing a truth table to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet's set up a truth table with all possible truth values for P and Q.

Hmm, okay. I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.\n\nThe statement says that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes. That sounds like it's related to the concept of prime factorization. I think every composite number can be broken down into prime factors, and primes themselves are just single prime numbers. So, primes are kind of the building blocks of integers.\n\nWait, but the question specifically mentions using strong induction for the proof. Hmm, okay. So maybe I should try to approach this using mathematical induction, specifically strong induction, which requires proving a base case and then showing that if the statement holds for an arbitrary integer n, it also holds for n+1.\n\nBut hold on, strong induction usually involves proving that if the statement holds for all integers up to some arbitrary n, then it holds for n+1.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that subsets have a transitive property, but I need to recall exactly how that works. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definitions. If A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. Similarly, if B is a subset of C, then every element in B is in C. So, if every element of A is in B and every element of B is in C, then by transitivity, every element of A should be in C. That makes sense intuitively, but I need to write this out formally.\n\nLet me start by taking an arbitrary element of A. Let\u2019s say x is in A. Since A is a subset of B, x must also be in B. Now, since B is a subset of C, x is also in C. Therefore, every element x in A is in C, which means A is a subset of C. \n\nWait, is that all? It feels too straightforward, but maybe that's the case. Let me think if there's a case where this might not hold. Suppose A is empty. Then A is a subset of any set, including C. So that works. If A has elements, then each one is in B and then in C. Yeah, it seems like the logic holds. \n\nMaybe I should write it more formally using logical implications. So, if x \u2208 A, then x \u2208 B (because A \u2286 B). And since x \u2208 B, then x \u2208 C (because B \u2286 C). Therefore, x \u2208 C. Since this is true for all x \u2208 A, A must be a subset of C.\n\nI think that's the proof.

I remember that syllogisms have two premises and a conclusion, and we need to determine if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nFirst, let me rephrase the statements to make it clearer. The first premise is \"If I don't wake up early, I will be late for work.\" Let me represent that as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"I don't wake up early\" and Q is \"I will be late for work.\" \n\nThe second premise is \"If I am late for work, I will get fired.\" So that's another conditional statement, which I can write as Q \u2192 R, where R is \"I will get fired.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"I did not get fired,\" which is the negation of R, so \u00acR.\n\nSo the argument is: P \u2192 Q, Q \u2192 R, \u00acR, and therefore \u00acP.\n\nWait, no, actually, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is the negation of \"I did not wake up early.\" So if waking up early is S, then \u00acS is \"I did not wake up early.\" But in the conclusion, it's stated as \"I did not get fired,\" which is \u00acR. So the conclusion is S.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nPremise 1: If I don't wake up early (\u00acS), then I will be late (Q). So \u00acS \u2192 Q.\n\nPremise 2: If I am late (Q), then I will get fired (R). So Q \u2192 R.\n\nConclusion: I did not get fired (\u00acR), so therefore I woke up early (S).\n\nWait, no, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is S. So S is waking up early, \u00acS is not waking up early.\n\nSo the conclusion is S, and the premises are \u00acS \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 R, and the fact is \u00acR.\n\nI think", "only_in_llm": ["So if waking up early is S, then \u00acS is \"I did not wake up early.\"", "So the conclusion is S.", "Let me clarify:", "So S is waking up early, \u00acS is not waking up early."], "only_in_manual": ["Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here."], "btk_llm": ["Wait, no, actually, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is the negation of \"I did not wake up early.\"", "So if waking up early is S, then \u00acS is \"I did not wake up early.\"", "But in the conclusion, it's stated as \"I did not get fired,\" which is \u00acR.", "So the conclusion is S.", "Let me clarify:", "Wait, no, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is S.", "So S is waking up early, \u00acS is not waking up early."], "btk_manual": ["Wait, no, actually, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is the negation of \"I did not wake up early.\"", "But in the conclusion, it's stated as \"I did not get fired,\" which is \u00acR.", "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.", "Wait, no, the conclusion is that I woke up early, which is S."]}, {"task_id": "math_logic_85", "task_problem": "Prove by contradiction that there is no rational number r such that r\u00b2 = 3.", "task_answer": "Alright, so I need to prove by contradiction that there's no rational number r such that r squared equals 3. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about rational numbers and irrational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if r is a rational number, then r can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b isn't zero. \n\nSo, if r = a/b, then r squared would be (a/b)^2, which is a\u00b2 divided by b\u00b2. The equation we need is r\u00b2 = 3, so that would mean a\u00b2/b\u00b2 = 3. If I rearrange this, it becomes a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2. So, I have two integers, a and b, such that when I square a, I get three times the square of b. \n\nHmm, that seems interesting. So, a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2 implies that a is equal to sqrt(3) times b, right? Because if I take both sides and take the square root, I get a = sqrt(3) * b. But wait, sqrt(3) is an irrational number, isn't it? Yeah, I remember that sqrt(3) can't be expressed as a simple fraction because its decimal goes on forever without repeating. So, if a and b are integers, then a is a multiple of an irrational number. But if a is a multiple of an irrational number and b is an integer, then a is also irrational. \n\nBut hold on, a is supposed to be an integer because r is rational, so a has to be rational as well. That seems like a contradiction because we have a being both rational and irrational at the same time, which isn't possible.

Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all possible scenarios. So, I need to check the truth table for (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (P \u2192 ~Q) and see if it matches the truth table for ~P.\n\nFirst, let me write down the truth tables for each part. I know that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q, right? So, maybe I can rewrite the original proposition using this equivalence to simplify it. Let me try that.\n\nSo, (P \u2192 Q) is ~P \u2228 Q, and (P \u2192 ~Q) is ~P \u2228 ~Q. So, the original statement becomes (~P \u2228 Q) \u2227 (~P \u2228 ~Q).

I remember that in logic, a set of premises is consistent if there's no contradiction derived from them. That means there shouldn't be a situation where something can be both true and false at the same time because of these premises.

R implies not P: R \u2192 ~P\n\nI think the first step is to see if I can derive any contradictions by chaining these implications together. Maybe if I chain them, I can find a contradiction.\n\nStarting with the first one, P \u2192 Q. If P is true, then Q must be true. Then, since Q is true, from the second premise Q \u2192 R, R must also be true. So, P \u2192 Q \u2192 R. Now, if R is true, then from the third premise R \u2192 ~P, ~P must be true. So, putting it all together: P \u2192 Q \u2192 R \u2192 ~P. So, if P is true, then ~P is also true. Wait, that sounds like a contradiction because something can't be both true and not true at the same time. So, is this a contradiction?\n\nWait, let me write that out symbolically. Starting with P, from P \u2192 Q we get Q. From Q, Q \u2192 R gives us R. From R, R \u2192 ~P gives us ~P. So, we have P \u2192 ~P. But P \u2192 ~P is a well-known logical formula that's a contradiction. It's a tautology of negation, meaning it's always false.

So, if I have two sets A and B, their intersection A \u2229 B consists of all elements that are in both A and B. The complement of that intersection, (A \u2229 B)', should then be all the elements that are not in both A and B. On the other hand, the union of the complements A' and B' would be all elements that are not in A or not in B or neither, right?\n\nWait, maybe I should write this down step by step. Let me recall the definitions:\n\n- A \u2229 B is the set of elements that are in both A and B.\n- A' is the set of all elements not in A.\n- Similarly, B' is the set of all elements not in B.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B)' is all elements not in A \u2229 B.

So, their union would cover everything not in A or not in B or both.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should use a Venn diagram to visualize this. Let me imagine two overlapping circles representing sets A and B. The intersection A \u2229 B is the overlapping part. The complement of that would be everything outside the overlapping part, which is the parts that are only in A, only in B, and neither. \n\nOn the other hand, A' is everything outside of A, which includes the part that's only in B and the part that's in neither.

It seems like a proof by contradiction might work here.

To use contradiction, I should assume the opposite. That would be: Assume that n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be true.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the contrapositive of this statement is \"If n is not even, then n\u00b2 is not even.\" That might be easier to work with because sometimes proving the contrapositive is simpler.

Because any odd integer can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nSo, if n = 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1)\u00b2. Let me expand that: (2k + 1)(2k + 1). Multiplying that out, I get 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, okay, so 4k\u00b2 is obviously even because it's 4 times something, 4k is also even, and 1 is odd. So, adding those together: even + even + odd.

Hmm, let's see. I need to think about how to approach this. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic properties of odd and even numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that an even number is any integer divisible by 2, right? So, even numbers are like 2, 4, 6, and so on. An odd number is any integer that isn't divisible by 2, like 1, 3, 5, etc. So, if I have two integers a and b, their sum being odd means that a + b is not divisible by 2.\n\nWait, let me write that down. If a + b is odd, then a + b is not divisible by 2. That means when I divide a + b by 2, there's a remainder of 1, right? Because odd numbers can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, a + b = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what that tells me about a and b individually. Let me consider the possible cases for a and b.

If a is even, then a = 2m for some integer m, and similarly, b = 2n for some integer n. So, a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n). That's clearly divisible by 2, so a + b is even. But the problem states that a + b is odd, so Case 1 can't happen. So, we can eliminate this case.\n\nCase 2: a is even, b is odd.

So, induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me start with the base case.\n\n**Base Case:**\nLet's take n = 1. Then, 4^1 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Is 3 divisible by 3?

So, P(A) contains all subsets of A, and P(B) contains all subsets of B.\n\nAlright, so if A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. I need to show that every subset of A is also a subset of B. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nLet\u2019s take an arbitrary subset C of A. Since C is a subset of A, by definition, every element in C is also in A. But since A is a subset of B, every element in A is also in B.

So, if I have C in P(A), then C is a subset of A. Since A is a subset of B, C is also a subset of B. Therefore, C is in P(B). Since this is true for any subset C of A, it follows that every element of P(A) is in P(B). So, P(A) is a subset of P(B).\n\nHold on, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using definitions more formally. Let me write this out:\n\n1. Let C be an arbitrary element of P(A). By definition of a power set, C is a subset of A.\n2.

A tautology is a statement that's always true, no matter what truth values its propositional variables take. A contradiction is a statement that's always false.

Using the distributive law, which says that A \u2227 (B \u2228 C) is equivalent to (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C), so applying that here, we get (P \u2227 \u00acP) \u2228 (P \u2227 Q). \n\nWait, P \u2227 \u00acP is a contradiction, right? Because if P is true, \u00acP is false, and if P is false, P \u2227 \u00acP is false. So, P \u2227 \u00acP is always false.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like a/b where a and b are integers and b isn't zero. Irrational numbers, on the other hand, can't be expressed as such fractions. Their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. So, if I add a rational number and an irrational number, the result should be irrational. \n\nLet me start by recalling the definitions. Let me denote a rational number as r = a/b, where a and b are integers, and b \u2260 0. An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, so let me call that number s. So, s is irrational. I need to show that r + s is irrational.\n\nHmm, how can I prove this? Maybe I can use proof by contradiction. That usually works well for these types of problems. So, let's assume the opposite of what I want to prove. That is, let me assume that r + s is rational. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then my original statement must be true.\n\nSo, assuming r + s is rational. Since r is rational, it can be written as a/b, and s is irrational. So, a/b + s is rational. Let me denote this sum as some rational number, say c/d, where c and d are integers and d \u2260 0. So, a/b + s = c/d.\n\nNow, if I rearrange this equation, I can express s in terms of c/d and a/b. Subtracting a/b from both sides gives me s = c/d - a/b. Let me write that as s = (c/d) - (a/b). To subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be b*d. So, s = (c*b)/(d*b) - (a*d)/(b*d) = (cb - ad)/bd.\n\nWait a minute. If s is equal to (cb - ad)/bd, then that fraction is a ratio of two integers, because c, d, a, and b are all integers. So, s is expressed as a fraction of two integers, which means s is rational.

So, essentially, if I have an integer n, and when I square it and add 5, the result is even, then that tells me something about whether n is odd or even. Specifically, it must be odd.

So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k, and if n is odd, then n = 2k + 1.\n\nMaybe I can consider both cases: one where n is even and one where n is odd, and see what happens when I square them and add 5.\n\nCase 1: Suppose n is even.

Well, 4k\u00b2 is definitely even because it's a multiple of 4, right? So, adding 5 to an even number gives me an odd number because 4k\u00b2 is even, 5 is odd, and even + odd = odd.

I need to figure out how many of these smaller cubes have exactly two red faces. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the original cube is divided into 27 smaller cubes. That means it's a 3x3x3 cube, right? So, each edge of the original cube is divided into three equal parts. Therefore, the cube has 3 layers along each dimension: length, width, and height.\n\nNow, the cube is painted on all its faces before being cut. That means all the outer surfaces are red. When we cut it into smaller cubes, the smaller cubes on the surface will have some red faces, and the ones inside won't have any. But the question specifically asks about the smaller cubes with exactly two red faces.\n\nLet me visualize the cube. The small cubes can be categorized based on their positions:\n\n1. **Corner cubes**: These are the cubes at the corners of the larger cube. Each corner cube has three faces exposed, so they would have three red faces. So, these are not the ones we're looking for since we want exactly two red faces.\n\n2. **Edge cubes (not corners)**: These are the cubes that lie along the edges but are not at the corners. Each edge of a cube has small cubes in between the corners. Since each edge is 3 small cubes long, the edge cubes that aren't corners are the middle ones. For a 3x3x3 cube, each edge has 3 small cubes, and subtracting the two corners, there's only 1 cube per edge that is not a corner. So, each edge has 1 such cube. Now, how many edges are there on a cube? A cube has 12 edges (each cube has 12 edges). So, that's 12 edge cubes, each with two red faces. Wait, but hold on, does each of these edge cubes have exactly two red faces? Let me think. If I take an edge cube, it's on two faces of the larger cube, so yes, it should have two red faces.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, I have a square piece of paper. Let me imagine it in front of me. If I fold it in half vertically, that means I'm bringing the left and right sides together. So, the paper becomes a rectangle, half as wide as it was before. Then, I fold it again in half horizontally, which would mean bringing the top and bottom edges together. Now, the paper is a smaller square, a quarter of the original size.\n\nBut wait, the next step is to cut off the corner where all the folds meet. So, after folding vertically and then horizontally, the corner where the two folds meet would be at the center of the original square. If I cut that corner off, what does that look like?\n\nWhen I unfold the paper, I should see the result of that cut. Let me think about how folding affects the paper. Each fold essentially mirrors the paper over that fold line. So, when I fold vertically, the left half is a mirror image of the right half, and when I fold horizontally, the top half is a mirror image of the bottom half.\n\nIf I cut off the corner where these two folds meet, which is the center, the cut will create a new edge. When I unfold it, the cut should reflect across both the vertical and horizontal folds, creating symmetrical cuts on the opposite sides. So, instead of just a single cut, I get four cuts, one at each corner of the original square, each at 45-degree angles, right?\n\nWait, is it four cuts? Let me make sure. When I fold vertically, the fold line is vertical, so the reflection will create a symmetrical cut on the other side. Similarly, the horizontal fold will create a symmetrical cut on the bottom. So, actually, it's like making an X shape when you unfold it, but only one of the diagonals is cut, so it's not an X.

A plane passes through this prism, creating a cross-section. I need to find the maximum possible area of this cross-section. Hmm, okay. I remember that cross-sections of prisms can vary depending on the angle of the plane cutting through them. The maximum area is usually when the cross-section is a face of the prism, but I'm not sure if that's always the case or if there's a larger cross-section possible by angling the plane.\n\nLet me think. A rectangular prism has six faces, each of which is a rectangle. The areas of these faces are 3\u00d74, 3\u00d75, and 4\u00d75. So, the largest face area is 4\u00d75, which is 20. But I feel like maybe there's a way to get a larger cross-section by not just cutting along a face but at an angle.\n\nI recall that the cross-sectional area can be larger than the face areas when the plane is at an angle, especially if it's cutting through the space diagonally. So, perhaps the maximum area cross-section is a parallelogram whose area is larger than 20. How do I figure this out?\n\nI think the key is to consider the vectors along the edges of the prism. The prism can be represented by vectors, and the cross-section area is related to the cross product of two vectors. Maybe if I can find two vectors that define the cross-section and compute their cross product, that could give me the area.\n\nLet me denote the edges of the prism as vectors. Let's say the prism has length, width, and height as 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

I need to figure out how the cubes are arranged. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize four cubes in a row. If they're all in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, but since we're viewing them from front, right, and above, it's more likely they're in a horizontal row. But I can't be sure yet.\n\nThe front view is a square. So, if I'm looking at the front, the projection of the cubes is a square. That suggests that the arrangement from the front must have equal height and width. Similarly, the right view is also a square, which would mean that from the right side, the projection is also a square. The top view is a rectangle with length four times its width, so from above, it's a longer rectangle.\n\nLet me consider the possible arrangements. Since all cubes are identical, each cube has the same size. Let me denote the side length of each cube as 's'. So, the dimensions of each cube are s x s x s.\n\nNow, when viewed from the front, the front view is a square. The front view would show the maximum height and width of the arrangement.

But with four cubes, if they are in a straight horizontal line, the front view would be a 4s x s rectangle, which is not a square unless 4s = s, which is only possible if s = 0, which isn't possible.

It has a square base with a side length of 10 cm and a height of 5 cm. The box is made from a single flat piece of cardboard, and I need to find the minimum area of cardboard needed. Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you make a box from a flat piece of cardboard, you're essentially folding the sides up to form the height. Since this box doesn't have a top, I only need to cover the base and the four sides. The base is a square, so that should be straightforward. But the tricky part is figuring out the dimensions of the cardboard needed so that when you fold it up, it forms the sides without overlapping or leaving gaps.\n\nLet me visualize the box. The base is 10 cm by 10 cm, so that's 100 cm\u00b2 in area. The height is 5 cm. Now, if I imagine the cardboard as a flat rectangle, the length and width of this rectangle will determine the size of the cardboard needed. The base of the box is going to take up some of this rectangle, and then the sides will fold up around it.\n\nWait, actually, no. When you make a box without a top, the cardboard isn't just a square; it's a rectangle that's longer and wider to accommodate the sides. Let me think about the dimensions of the cardboard before it's cut and folded.\n\nSo, if the base is 10x10 cm, that's the footprint on the cardboard. Then, for the sides, each side will have a certain height and length. Since the height is 5 cm, each side will extend 5 cm up from the base. But the length of the sides depends on how the cardboard is folded.\n\nI think the key here is that the cardboard must be wide enough so that when folded up, the sides meet properly. So, if the base is 10 cm on each side, then the length of the cardboard must be at least 10 cm in one direction, and the width must be such that when folded, the sides can meet.

The sphere has a radius of 5 cm, and the hole has a radius of 2 cm.

Volume of a sphere: \\( V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\)\n2. Volume of a cylinder: \\( V_{cylinder} = \\pi r^2 h \\)\n3.

I need to figure out what shape this will result in and how many faces it will have. Hmm, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know a cube has 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each edge is the same length, right? So if I'm cutting off each corner, which is essentially truncating the cube, I need to understand how each cut affects the cube's shape.\n\nThe problem says the cuts pass through points that divide each edge in a 1:2 ratio. That means, for each edge, the point where we make the cut is 1/3 of the way from one vertex to the other. So, on each edge, which is, let's say, length 'a', the cut will be made at a distance of a/3 from one end and 2a/3 from the other.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the ratio is 1:2, it's divided into three equal parts. So each part is a third. So, the point is located 1/3 from one end and 2/3 from the other. That makes sense. So, for each edge, the cut is made at 1/3 and 2/3 points.\n\nNow, when you slice off a corner of a cube, you're replacing that corner with a new face. Since each corner is a vertex where three edges meet, cutting off the corner with a plane will create a new triangular face in place of that corner. But in this case, since we're cutting through points that are 1/3 along each edge, the shape of the new face might not be a regular triangle.\n\nLet me think, in a cube, each corner is a right angle. If we cut off each corner such that each cut is 1/3 along each edge, the intersection of these three cuts near the corner will form a triangle. Since all edges are equal, the triangle should be an equilateral triangle. Wait, is that correct? Because each cut is 1/3 along each edge, but the edges are all of equal length, so the sides of the triangle will be equal. So, yes, each new face is an equilateral triangle.\n\n", "only_in_llm": [], "only_in_manual": ["But in this case, since we're cutting through points that are 1/3 along each edge, the shape of the new face might not be a regular triangle.", "Wait, is that correct?"], "btk_llm": ["Wait, no, actually, if the ratio is 1:2, it's divided into three equal parts."], "btk_manual": ["Wait, no, actually, if the ratio is 1:2, it's divided into three equal parts.", "But in this case, since we're cutting through points that are 1/3 along each edge, the shape of the new face might not be a regular triangle.", "Wait, is that correct?"]}, {"task_id": "spatial_7", "task_problem": "A right circular cone has height 12 cm and base radius 5 cm. A plane parallel to the base cuts the cone at a height of 8 cm from the base. What is the radius of the resulting circular cross-section?", "task_answer": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a right circular cone. The cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. A plane is cutting the cone parallel to the base, and it's cutting at a height of 8 cm from the base. I need to find the radius of the circular cross-section that results from this cut.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. A right circular cone has a circular base, and if I make a vertical slice through its axis, I get a triangle. If I make a horizontal cut somewhere along the cone, parallel to the base, the cross-section would be a smaller circle. Since the cut is parallel to the base, the smaller circle should be similar to the base circle. \n\nWait, similarity! Yeah, similar triangles. I remember that when you have similar figures, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So, the original cone and the smaller cone that's cut off should be similar. \n\nLet me write down the given information. The original cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. So, the original cone has height H = 12 cm and radius R = 5 cm. The plane cuts the cone at a height of 8 cm from the base. Hmm, so from the base, which is at the bottom, 8 cm up, so the height from the apex (the top point) to this cut must be H' = 12 - 8 = 4 cm.\n\nWait, so the smaller cone that's cut off has height 4 cm, and the original cone is 12 cm. So, the ratio of the heights is H' / H = 4 / 12 = 1/3. Since the cones are similar, the ratio of the radii should also be 1/3. So, the radius of the smaller cone would be r' = R * (1/3) = 5 * (1/3) = 5/3 cm.\n\nBut wait, hold on, is that the radius at the cut? Let me think. If I have the original cone with radius 5 cm at the base, and I cut it 8 cm from the base, then the smaller cone on top will have a height of 4 cm. So, the radius at that height should be proportional.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the cross-sectional triangle.

If the hole has a radius of 2 cm, what is the volume of the remaining solid?", "task_answer": "Okay, so I have this problem about a cube with a hole drilled through it. Let me try to visualize it. The cube has a side length of 10 cm, so each edge is 10 cm long. They've drilled a hole through it, and the hole is circular with a radius of 2 cm. The hole is centered on a line connecting the centers of opposite faces. Hmm, I think that means the hole goes straight through the cube from one face to the opposite face.\n\nAlright, so first, maybe I should figure out the volume of the original cube and then subtract the volume of the hole that's been drilled out. That should give me the remaining volume, right?\n\nThe volume of the cube is straightforward. Since it's a cube, all sides are equal. So, the volume is side length cubed. That would be 10 cm times 10 cm times 10 cm. Let me calculate that: 10*10 is 100, times 10 is 1000. So, the cube has a volume of 1000 cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, the tricky part is figuring out the volume of the hole that's been drilled. The hole is a cylinder, I think, because it's a circular hole through the cube. The radius is given as 2 cm. So, the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length) of the cylinder. But wait, in this case, the hole is drilled through the cube, so the height of the cylinder would actually be the same as the side length of the cube, right? Because it goes from one face to the opposite face.\n\nSo, the length of the cylinder is 10 cm. The radius is 2 cm, so plugging into the formula, the volume would be \u03c0*(2)^2*10. Let me compute that: 2 squared is 4, times 10 is 40, so \u03c0*40 is approximately 125.66 cm\u00b3. But hold on, is it that simple?\n\nWait a second. When you drill a hole through a cube like that, you're not just removing a simple cylinder. Because the hole is drilled through the cube, the cross-section isn't just a flat circle; it's a circle that's been expanded as it goes through the cube. Hmm, actually, no, wait.
