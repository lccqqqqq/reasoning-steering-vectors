Hmm, I need to prove that. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that integers can be either even or odd. Even numbers are divisible by 2, right? Like 2, 4, 6, and so on. Odd numbers are the ones that aren't divisible by 2, like 1, 3, 5, etc. So if n is an integer, it's either even or odd, and we're told that when we square it, n squared is odd. So, I need to show that n itself must be odd.\n\nLet me recall some properties of even and odd numbers. When you multiply two even numbers together, the result is even. For example, 2 times 2 is 4, which is even. Also, when you multiply an even number by an odd number, the result is even. Wait, is that right? Let me test that. 2 times 3 is 6, which is even. Yeah, that seems correct. Now, what happens when you multiply two odd numbers? I think the result is odd. Let me check: 3 times 3 is 9, which is odd; 5 times 7 is 35, also odd. So, it seems that odd times odd is odd, even times even is even, and even times odd is even.\n\nSo, in general, if n is even, then n can be written as 2k, where k is some integer. If n is odd, it can be written as 2k + 1, right? Maybe I can use this to figure out what n squared would be.\n\nLet me consider two cases: one where n is even and one where n is odd.\n\nCase 1: Suppose n is even. Then n = 2k",

Hmm, I remember that an irrational number can't be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like a/b where a and b are integers and b isn't zero. So, if I can show that the square root of 2 can't be written as a simple fraction, then it's irrational. \n\nI think the standard way to prove this is by using a proof by contradiction. That means I'll assume the opposite of what I want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, let me start by assuming that the square root of 2 is rational. \n\nAlright, so let's say \u221a2 is equal to a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common divisors other than 1 (because if they had a common divisor, I can simplify the fraction). So, \u221a2 = a/b, where a and b are coprime integers, and b is positive. \n\nIf I square both sides of the equation, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2.

So, a\u00b2 is twice b squared. \n\nHmm, if a\u00b2 is twice b squared, then a must be divisible by 2 because 2 is a prime number. Let me write that down: since a\u00b2 is even, a must also be even. If a is even, then a can be expressed as 2k, where k is some integer. \n\nSo, substituting back into the equation, a = 2k. Then, a\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2.

Hmm, that sounds like something basic about set theory, but I want to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for one set to be a subset of another. If I remember correctly, if A is a subset of B, written as A \u2286 B, that means every element in set A is also in set B. Similarly, if B is a subset of C, written as B \u2286 C, then every element in B is also in C. So, if both of these are true, then every element in A must also be in C, right? That should mean that A is a subset of C. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should think about it more carefully.\n\nLet me write down the definitions:\n\n1. A \u2286 B means that for all elements x, if x \u2208 A, then x \u2208 B.\n2. B \u2286 C means that for all elements y, if y \u2208 B, then y \u2208 C.\n\nSo, if I take an arbitrary element x in A, by the first definition, x must also be in B. Then, since x is in B, by the second definition, x must also be in C. Therefore, every element of A is in C, which by definition means A is a subset of C.\n\nWait, that seems too quick.

Hmm, induction can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I need to check the base case, which is usually n = 1. So, plugging in n = 1 into the series, I get just the first term, which is 1. On the other side, the formula gives 1*(3*1 - 1)/2, which is (1*2)/2 = 1. Okay, so the base case works out. That\u2019s good.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning I assume that the sum up to the kth term is equal to k(3k - 1)/2. So, let's denote S(k) = 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) = k(3k - 1)/2.\n\nThen, I need to show that S(k + 1) = (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2. S(k + 1) would be the sum up to the (k + 1)th term, which is S(k) plus the next term in the series. The next term after (3k - 2) is (3(k + 1) - 2) = 3k + 3 - 2 = 3k + 1.

Let me start by recalling what each notation means.\n\nFirst, \u2200x\u2203y(P(x,y)) translates to \"For all x, there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true.\" So, for every single x, I can find some y that relates to it through P.

In the first case, the y is dependent on x, meaning each x can have a different y. In the second case, the y is fixed, so it's the same y for all x. So, it's like in math when you say \"for every x, there's a unique y,\" versus \"there's a single y that works for all x.\"\n\nTo show they're not equivalent, I should probably come up with a counterexample.

Hmm, this seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand each step clearly. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that in logic, \"P implies Q\" means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. Similarly, \"Q implies R\" means that if Q is true, then R must be true. So, if I can connect these two statements, maybe I can show that P being true leads to R being true.\n\nLet me think about truth tables.

Is there a more logical way?\n\nOh, right, in logic, implication can be represented with truth tables or natural deduction. Maybe I can use natural deduction here. So, starting with P, I can assume P is true, then from P, by modus ponens, I can get Q. Since Q implies R, I can use modus ponens again on Q to get R. Therefore, from P, I can derive R. So, P implies R.\n\nWait, is that all? It feels too simple. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. So, if P implies Q and Q implies R, then combining these two implications should give me P implies R. Yeah, that makes sense because the truth of P ensures the truth of Q, which in turn ensures the truth of R.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as F\u2081 = 1, F\u2082 = 1, and then each subsequent term is the sum of the two previous ones. So, F\u2083 = 2, F\u2084 = 3, F\u2085 = 5, and so on. The statement I need to prove is that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F\u2099 = F_{n+2} - 1. \n\nFirst, let me recall what mathematical induction entails. There are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to verify that the statement holds true for the initial value of n, usually n=1. Then, for the inductive step, I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary n = k, and then I need to show that it must also be true for n = k+1.\n\nLet me start with the base case. So, for n=1, the left side is just F\u2081, which is 1. The right side is F_{1+2} - 1, which is F\u2083 - 1. We know that F\u2083 is 2, so 2 - 1 equals 1. Therefore, both sides are equal when n=1. That checks out.\n\nNext, for the inductive step. Let's assume that the statement is true for n = k, meaning that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_k = F_{k+2} - 1. Now, I need to show that F\u2081 + F\u2082 + ... + F_{k+1} = F_{(k+1)+2} - 1, which simplifies to F_{k+3} - 1.\n\nTo do this",

Hmm, let me think. I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\nThe statement says every positive integer can be written as a product of primes. I think this is related to the concept of prime factorization.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what a subset is. A subset of a set S is any set that contains some or all elements of S, right? So, for example, if S has 3 elements, say {a, b, c}, then the subsets are the empty set, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, and {a, b, c}. That's 8 subsets in total. But wait, the question is about proper subsets. \n\nI think a proper subset is a subset that doesn't include all the elements of S. So, in the example, the proper subsets would be all except the set S itself. That means the empty set, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}. So that's 7 subsets, which is 2^3 - 1. Ah, okay, so for n=3, 2^n - 1 gives 7, which matches the number of proper subsets. \n\nSo, in general, for a set S with n elements, the total number of subsets is 2^n because for each element, you have two choices: include it or not.

But if we exclude the set S itself, which is one subset, then the number of proper subsets would be 2^n - 1. \n\nWait, is that all? Let me check with another example to make sure. Let's take n=2.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you see a sum of powers of 2 like this, it's a geometric series. A geometric series is where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In this case, the ratio is 2 because each term is double the previous one. So, 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on. I think there's a formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall it.\n\nI believe the formula for the sum of the first k terms of a geometric series is S_k = a(r^k - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and k is the number of terms. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yeah, I think that's correct. So in this case, the first term a is 1, the ratio r is 2, and the number of terms is n because we're going from 2^0 up to 2^(n-1). So that should be n terms.\n\nSo plugging into the formula, S_n = 1*(2^n - 1)/(2 - 1). Since 2 - 1 is 1, that simplifies to 2^n - 1. So that seems to match the statement given. So, is that the proof?

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. First, I know that real numbers include all the fractions, integers, decimals, and irrational numbers like sqrt(2) or pi. Rational numbers, on the other hand, are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, like 1/2 or 3/4. So, the task is to show that no matter which two real numbers you pick, there's always another rational number sitting right in between them.\n\nLet me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track. A real number can be either rational or irrational. If a number can be written as a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero, then it's rational. Otherwise, it's irrational. So, if I have two real numbers, say a and b, I need to show there's a rational number between them.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"any two real numbers,\" so they could be any two numbers, right? They could be both rational, both irrational, or one rational and one irrational. Hmm, okay, so I need to handle all these cases.\n\nLet me think about the case where both numbers are rational. If I have two rational numbers, then I know that their average is also a rational number. For example, if I take (a + b)/2, that should be rational because adding two rationals gives a rational, and dividing by 2 (which is also rational) gives a rational. So, if I have two rational numbers, say 1/2 and 3/4, their average is (1/2 + 3/4)/2 = (5/4)/2 = 5/8, which is rational. So, in this case, 5/8 is between 1/2 and 3/4",

Hmm, okay. I remember that a set is countable if it has the same size as the natural numbers, right?

First, suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the real numbers between 0 and 1 are countable. That means we can list them in a sequence like r1, r2, r3, and so on.

The question is asking me to show that there isn't a biggest prime number, meaning no matter how big a prime you have, there's always a bigger one. \n\nI remember something about Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes. Maybe I can use that approach. Let me recall how that works. Euclid assumed that if you have a finite list of primes, you can multiply them all together and add 1. That product is not divisible by any of the primes in the list, so it must be either a new prime or a prime not on the list. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes.\n\nBut I need to make sure I understand each step clearly.

If I suppose that some prime Q less than or equal to P divides P! + 1, then Q would divide (P! + 1) - P! = 1. But that's a contradiction because primes can't divide 1.

On the other hand, the intersection of two sets, denoted as B \u2229 C, includes only the elements that are in both B and C. So, A - (B \u222a C) should be all the elements in A that are not in B or C. \n\nWait, okay, so if I take A and remove all the elements that are in B or C, I'm left with elements that are only in A but not in B or C. That makes sense. Now, the right side of the equation is (A - B) \u2229 (A - C). Let me think about what that means. A - B is all elements in A not in B, and A - C is all elements in A not in C. So, their intersection would be elements that are in both A - B and A - C, which means elements that are in A but not in B and also in A but not in C. So, that should also be elements only in A, but not in B or C. \n\nSo, both sides seem to be referring to the same set: elements in A that are not in B or C. Therefore, maybe they are equal.

The question is whether this is a tautology or not. Hmm, I remember that a tautology is a statement that's always true, no matter what truth values you assign to the propositional variables, right? So, I need to figure out if this expression is always true.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I understand it. It's ((P implies Q) and (Q implies R)) implies (P implies R). So, in logical terms, that's ( (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R) ) \u2192 (P \u2192 R). Okay, so it's an implication where the antecedent is the conjunction of two implications, and the consequent is another implication.\n\nI think I should start by recalling what implication means in logic. An implication P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true and Q is false. So, if P is true and Q is false, then P \u2192 Q is false. Otherwise, it's true. So, maybe I can use truth tables to evaluate this expression.\n\nBut before jumping into a truth table, maybe there's a way to simplify the expression or use some logical equivalences. Let me see. The antecedent is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (Q \u2192 R). I remember that the conjunction of two implications can be rewritten using the logical biconditional, but wait, is that right? Let me think.

Every even number is divisible by 2, but n squared being divisible by 4 doesn't necessarily make n even. For example, 3 squared is 9, which is not divisible by 4. Wait, but hold on, 3 squared is 9, which is 1 modulo 4. So maybe I need to think differently.\n\nActually, if a number is divisible by 4, that means when you divide it by 4, there is no remainder. So if n squared is divisible by 4, that means n squared is a multiple of 4. So n squared is a multiple of 4, but does that mean n is a multiple of 2? Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think. If n is even, then n is a multiple of 2, so n squared would be a multiple of 4 because (2k)^2 = 4k^2. So if n is even, n squared is divisible by 4. But the converse is not necessarily true. If n squared is divisible by 4, does that mean n is even?\n\nWait, no, because n could be odd. For example, if n is odd, then n is 2k+1 for some integer k.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that induction is a mathematical proof technique where you prove a base case and then show that if it holds for an arbitrary case, it holds for the next one. So, probably I'll need to use mathematical induction here.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the first n odd natural numbers are. Well, the first odd natural number is 1, then 3, 5, 7, and so on.

Hmm, okay. I remember from my math classes that proving a number is irrational can be tricky, but I think one common method is to assume the opposite and then reach a contradiction. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's define what an irrational number is. An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? So, if \u221a3 were rational, then it could be written as a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me assume the opposite of what I want to prove. Let's say that \u221a3 is rational. That means there exist integers a and b such that \u221a3 = a/b, and the fraction a/b is in its simplest form, meaning that a and b have no common factors other than 1. Also, b can't be zero because you can't divide by zero.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation, I get 3 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. Then, multiplying both sides by b\u00b2, I get 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So, this implies that a\u00b2 is equal to 3 times b squared. Therefore, a\u00b2 is divisible by 3. If a\u00b2 is divisible by 3, that means a must also be divisible by 3, right? Because if a square is divisible by a prime number, then the number itself must be divisible by that prime. I think that's a property of primes.\n\nSo, if a is divisible by 3, we can express a as 3k, where k is some integer. Let's substitute that back into the equation. If a = 3k, then a\u00b2 = (3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2. So, plugging that back into 3b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, we get",

Maybe they want a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.\n\nOkay, so to prove that every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers, I need to use induction or some other method. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.\n\nNow, the statement is that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes. This is essentially the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. So, I need to prove that every integer n > 1 can be factored into primes.\n\nLet me try to use mathematical induction for this proof. Induction is a common method for proving statements about integers.\n\n**Base Case:** Let's start with n = 2. 2 is a prime number, so it can be written as 2, which is a product of primes (just itself). So, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some integer k \u2265 2, every integer from 2 up to k can be written as a product of prime numbers. Now, we need to show that",

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that a rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. So, if I assume that such a number r exists, then r can be written as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers, and b is not zero. So, let's say r = a/b, and both a and b are in their simplest terms, meaning that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1.\n\nGiven that r squared equals 3, so (a/b)\u00b2 = 3. If I multiply both sides by b squared, I get a squared equals 3 times b squared. So, a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2. Hmm, so this tells me that a squared is three times b squared. That means that 3 divides a squared, right? Because a\u00b2 is equal to 3 times something. So, 3 is a factor of a\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, if 3 divides a squared, then 3 must also divide a, because if a prime divides a squared, it must divide a. Is that right? Yeah, I think that's a theorem or something. So, if 3 divides a\u00b2, then 3 divides a. So, let's say a is equal to 3k, where k is some integer.\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2, we get (3k)\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2. That simplifies to 9k\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2.

In other words, (A \u2229 B)' = A' \u222a B'. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the complement of a set means. If I have a universal set U, then the complement of a set X, denoted as X', is all the elements in U that are not in X. So, A' would be all elements in U not in A, and B' would be all elements in U not in B.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what (A \u2229 B)' means. That is the complement of the intersection of A and B. So, that would be all elements in U that are not in both A and B at the same time. In other words, elements that are in A but not in B, or in B but not in A, or neither. So, that sounds like the union of the complements of A and B. Because A' includes everything not in A, which includes elements not in both A and B, and similarly for B'. So, if I take the union of A' and B', I should get all elements that are not in A or not in B, which is the same as not in both A and B.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that integers can be classified as even or odd.

It says: Express the negation of the statement '\u2200x\u2200y\u2203z(P(x,y) \u2192 Q(y,z))'. Hmm, I need to figure out how to negate this statement. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that negating a statement involves changing the quantifiers and the logical connectives. The original statement is a universal quantifier for x and y, and an existential quantifier for z. The main connective is an implication, P(x,y) \u2192 Q(y,z). \n\nSo, the original statement is: For all x and y, there exists a z such that if P(x,y) then Q(y,z). So, in logical symbols, that's \u2200x\u2200y\u2203z(P(x,y) \u2192 Q(y,z)). \n\nNow, to negate this, I recall that the negation of \u2200x is \u2203x and the negation of \u2203z is \u2200z. Also, the negation of an implication P \u2192 Q is P \u2227 \u00acQ. So applying that, let me break it down.\n\nStarting from the outside: the whole statement is \u2200x\u2200y\u2203z(something). So, the negation would be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(negation of something). The something is (P(x,y) \u2192 Q(y,z)), whose negation is P(x,y) \u2227 \u00acQ(y,z). So putting it all together, the negation should be \u2203x\u2203y\u2203z(P(x,y) \u2227 \u00acQ(y,z)). \n\nWait, let me double-check.

Since any integer n can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3, I can check each case separately.\n\nCase 1: n \u2261 0 mod 3. Then, n\u00b3 \u2261 0\u00b3 \u2261 0 mod 3.
