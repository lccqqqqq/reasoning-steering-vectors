What is the probability that exactly 7 students are assigned to group #1?\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out. So, first, I need to understand the problem correctly. There are 30 students, and each one is assigned to one of 5 groups. So, each student has 5 choices, right? And each choice is equally likely. So, I guess this is a probability problem involving combinations and maybe permutations?\n\nWait, no, actually, since the assignments are random, it's more about combinations. Because the order in which we assign the students doesn't matter, just the number that ends up in each group. So, I think this is a multinomial distribution problem. Yeah, because each trial (assigning a student) can result in one of several categories (the 5 groups).\n\nSo, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of having a certain number of outcomes in each category. The formula for the multinomial probability is:\n\nP(k1, k2, ..., kn) = n! / (k1! k2! ... kn!) * (p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... pn^kn)\n\nWhere n is the total number of trials, which is 30 in this case, and k1, k2, ..., kn are the number of outcomes for each category. In this problem, we're looking for exactly 7 students in group #1, and the rest can be distributed among the other groups. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the distribution for the other groups. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of it as a multinomial distribution where we fix the number for group 1 and sum the rest. So, if exactly 7 are in group 1, then the remaining 23 students are distributed among",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple trials, especially with a fixed number of successes, the binomial probability formula might be useful here. Yeah, binomial distribution. So, in this case, each roll of the die is an independent trial, and getting a six is a success. The die is fair, so the probability of success on each trial is 1/6, and the probability of failure is 5/6.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting exactly 3 sixes in 10 rolls. So, that would be a binomial probability where n = 10, k = 3, probability of success p = 1/6, and probability of failure q = 5/6.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n - k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, right?

Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on. The first one to flip heads wins the game. I need to figure out the probability that Alice will win the game.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's break it down. The coin is fair, so the probability of getting heads on any flip is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5. Since they're flipping until someone gets heads, the game could end on the first turn, the second, third, fourth, etc.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios where Alice can win. Alice can win on her first flip, or if both she and Bob flip tails the first time, then Alice flips again, and so on.\n\nSo, the probability that Alice wins on her first flip is straightforward. She just needs to flip heads. That's probability 0.5.\n\nBut if she doesn't get heads on her first flip, which is also probability 0.5, then Bob gets a chance to flip. If Bob also flips tails, then it goes back to Alice. So, the game can go on multiple rounds.\n\nThis seems like an infinite geometric series.

The test has a 98% sensitivity and a 95% specificity.

Hmm, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probability, it's often helpful to figure out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I should probably start by determining how many total possible outcomes there are when rolling three dice. Since each die has 6 sides, and each die is independent, I can use the multiplication principle. That would be 6 * 6 * 6, which is 216. So, there are 216 possible outcomes in total.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how many of these outcomes result in the sum of 10. This is where I might need to use some combinatorics, maybe something like combinations or permutations, but I need to be careful because the order matters here since each die is distinct. Wait, actually, in probability, when the order matters, it's about permutations, right? But in this case, since each die is a separate entity, the order does matter because rolling a 1 on the first die, 2 on the second, and 7 on the third is different from rolling 7, 2, and 1, even though both add up to 10.

If 4 bulbs are selected at random, what is the probability that at least one of them is defective?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here: there's a box with 10 light bulbs, and 3 of them are defective. I need to find the probability that if I select 4 bulbs at random, at least one of them is defective. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when it comes to probabilities involving combinations, sometimes it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtracting from 1. So, in this case, the opposite of having at least one defective bulb would be having no defective bulbs at all. That seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. The probability of at least one defective bulb when selecting 4 is equal to 1 minus the probability of selecting no defective bulbs when selecting 4. That is:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(no defective)\n\nNow, I need to compute P(no defective). Since there are 3 defective bulbs in the box, that means there are 10 - 3 = 7 good bulbs.\n\nSo, when selecting 4 bulbs, the number of ways to choose all good bulbs is the combination of 7 good bulbs taken 4 at a time, which is denoted as C(7,4). The total number of ways to choose any 4 bulbs from 10 is C(10,4). Therefore, the probability of selecting no defective bulbs is C(7,4)/C(10,4).\n\nI should remember the formula for combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where \"n!\" stands for n factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nLet me compute C(7,4) first. So, 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = (7*6*5*",

Is this a binomial situation? Well, yes, because each flip is an independent trial with two possible outcomes: heads or tails. So, each flip doesn't depend on the previous one, and we're looking for the probability of a specific number of successes, which is getting 5 heads.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is given by:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of getting exactly k successes,\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial,\n- n is the total number of trials.\n\nIn this case, n is 8 because the coin is flipped 8 times. k is 5 because we want exactly 5 heads.

I need to find the probability that if I draw three marbles without replacement, they will be drawn in the order red, green, blue. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out how many ways there are to draw the marbles in the specific order R, G, B and then divide that by the total number of ways to draw any three marbles.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of marbles. There are 5 red, 3 green, and 2 blue marbles. So, total marbles = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 marbles. Got that. Now, the total number of ways to draw 3 marbles from 10 is a combination problem, right? Since the order doesn't matter when we're just drawing them. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10, 3). Let me compute that: 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120.

So, the total number of possible 5-card hands is the combination of 52 cards taken 5 at a time.

So, if the probability of success is 0.3, then the expected number of trials should be 1 divided by 0.3, which is approximately 3.333... So, is that the answer? Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should derive it myself to be sure. Let me think. Let's denote the random variable X as the number of trials until the first success. So, X can be 1, 2, 3, and so on. The probability that X = k is the probability that the first k-1 trials are failures and the k-th trial is a success. Since the trials are independent, the probability of a failure in each trial is 1 - p, which is 0.7 in this case.\n\nSo, the probability mass function (PMF) of X is P(X = k) = (0.7)^{k-1} * 0.3 for k = 1",

We have a box with 15 chips: 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green, and 3 yellow. I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 3 chips without replacement, I get exactly one red chip and exactly one blue chip.\n\nHmm, okay. So, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that often it's about figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That is, Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes).\n\nSo, first, I need to find the total number of ways to select 3 chips out of 15. Since the order doesn't matter in selection, this is a combination problem, right? So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(15, 3), which is 15 choose 3.\n\nLet me compute that. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, plugging in the numbers: 15! / (3! * 12!) = (15 * 14 * 13) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 455. So, 455 total possible ways to pick 3 chips.\n\nNow, for the favorable outcomes: selecting exactly 1 red and exactly 1 blue chip. So, we need to select 1 red out of 5, 1 blue out of 4, and then the third chip can be either green or yellow. Since we can't have more than 1 red and 1 blue, the third chip has to be from the remaining colors.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify.

Hmm, sounds like a classic probability problem. I think it might be related to something called the \"coupon collector problem.\" Yeah, that rings a bell. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFrom what I remember, the coupon collector problem deals with determining the expected number of trials needed to collect all types of coupons, given that each type has an equal probability of being obtained in each trial. Since a die has six sides, each roll is like a trial, and each face is a coupon. So, in this case, I'm trying to collect all six coupons (faces), and each time I roll, I get a random one with equal probability.\n\nSo, how do we calculate the expected number of rolls? I think it involves some sort of summation or maybe using the concept of harmonic numbers. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the process. When you start, you have zero faces seen. Then, on each roll, you might see a new face or a face you've already seen. The expected number of rolls needed to see all six faces can be thought of as the sum of the expected number of rolls needed to go from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on, up to 5 to 6 faces.\n\nSo, if I denote E(n) as the expected number of additional rolls needed to see all n faces, then the total expected number E(6) is just E(0) + E(1) + E(2) + E(3) + E(4) + E(5). But actually, wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Maybe it's more like E(6) = E(",

Each initial is chosen randomly from the 26 letters in the English alphabet. So, each initial is like a letter from A to Z, right? So, for each student, their initials are two different letters, probably, but the problem doesn't specify if they have to be different or not. Hmm, does that matter? Hmm. Wait, probably not necessarily different, because the problem just says \"two initials chosen randomly from the 26 letters.\" So, maybe they could have the same initial for first and last, like John J. Doe, right? So, initials can be the same or different.\n\nBut wait, actually, when people have initials, typically, they're different, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's allowed. Hmm, okay, so I need to consider that each initial is chosen independently, right? So, each student has a first initial and a last initial, each from 26 letters, so 26 possibilities for the first initial, 26 for the last. So, for each student, there are 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations of initials.\n\nSo, the total number of possible pairs is 676.

Using a balance scale, what is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the counterfeit coin with certainty?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where there's a box with 8 coins, and one of them is counterfeit. The counterfeit coin is lighter than the others. I need to figure out the minimum number of weighings required to identify which one is counterfeit using just a balance scale. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a balance scale can compare two groups of items and tell me if one side is heavier, lighter, or if they're equal. Since the counterfeit is lighter, that should help me narrow things down. I think this is similar to the classic counterfeit coin problem, but usually, those have more coins, like 12 or something. Maybe the strategy is similar though.\n\nSo, with 8 coins, I need a systematic way to compare them so that each weighing gives me as much information as possible. Let me recall how information theory works here. Each weighing can have three possible outcomes: left side heavier, right side heavier, or both sides equal. So, each weighing gives me log base 3 information, right? Or something like that. Maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in each weighing, I can divide the coins into groups and compare them. The goal is to minimize the number of weighings, so I should divide the coins into as equal groups as possible each time. Since 8 isn't a power of 3, the first division won't be perfect.

Each person randomly selects a floor to exit (other than the ground floor). What is the probability that no two people exit at the same floor?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nWait, let's see. So, the problem is about five people entering an elevator on the ground floor of a building with 10 floors, and each person needs to choose a floor to exit on. The question is asking for the probability that no two people exit at the same floor. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many total possible ways the five people can choose their floors. Since each person has 10 choices (from 1 to 10), and they're choosing independently, I think this is a permutation problem. So, the total number of possible ways is 10 multiplied by itself five times, which is 10^5. Let me write that down: total ways = 10^5 = 100,000.\n\nNow, the next part is the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways that all five people can choose different floors. Since they can't choose the same floor, this is similar to assigning each person a unique floor. So, for the first person, there are 10 choices, the second person has 9 choices (since one floor is already taken), the third person has 8 choices, and so on until the fifth person, who has 6 choices. So, that would be 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6. Let me calculate that: 10\u00d79 is 90, 90\u00d78 is 720, 720\u00d77 is 5040, 5040\u00d76 is 30,240. So, 30,240 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. That would be 30,240 divided by 100,000. Let me compute that. 30,240 divided by 100,000 is 0.3024. To express this as a fraction, I can write it as 3024/10000, which can be simplified. Both",

Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the setup is that there are three doors: one has a car, and the other two have goats. The contestant picks one door, then the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat. Then the contestant is given the choice to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door. The question is, should the contestant switch, and if so, what's the probability of winning the car?\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me break this down. First, there are three doors. Let me visualize it: Door 1, Door 2, Door 3. Behind one of them is a car, and the other two are goats. The contestant picks a door. Let's say they pick Door 1. Then the host, who knows where the car is, opens another door, say Door 3, revealing a goat. Now the contestant is given the option to switch to Door 2. The question is, should they switch?\n\nI remember something about this being a probability problem, often used to explain conditional probability. The initial probability of winning the car is 1/3, right? Because there are three doors, and only one has the car. So, the contestant has a 1 in 3 chance of picking the correct door initially. But then the host opens another door, revealing a goat. So, does that change the probability?\n\nLet me think. If the contestant initially picked a goat, then the host is forced to open the other goat door. So, if the contestant initially picked a goat, there's only one remaining door without a goat, which is the car. So, if the contestant switches, they'll win the car.

Yeah, that sounds familiar.

What is the probability that the committee has at least 2 women?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have a total of 5 men and 4 women, so that's 9 people in total. We need to form a committee of 3 people, and we want the probability that this committee has at least 2 women. \"At least 2 women\" means that the committee could have 2 women and 1 man or 3 women.

Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, which is the case here since we're selecting people for a committee regardless of the order they're selected in.\n\nSo, first, I should figure out the total number of possible committees. Since we're choosing 3 people out of 9, the total number of possible committees is the combination of 9 choose 3. I remember the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.

You have a fair six-sided die, so each roll has an equal probability of landing on 1 through 6. You can roll up to three times, but you can choose to stop after each roll.

So, we need to find E(3), which is the expected value when you have three rolls remaining.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should think in terms of the number of rolls you've already made.

So, E(0) would be the expected value before any rolls, but since you have to start, maybe E(1) is after the first roll.\n\nBut actually, maybe it's better to model it as the expected value given the number of rolls remaining.

I need to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 0.5. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me think. I remember something about probability and combinations. Maybe it's the pigeonhole principle? Yeah, that sounds right. The pigeonhole principle is when you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, so at least two pigeons must share a hole. Translating that into this problem, the pigeons are the people, and the pigeonholes are the days of the year.\n\nSo, if I have 365 days, and I want to know how many people I need so that at least two share a birthday, that would be when n is greater than 365. But wait, that might not be the exact probability. Because the probability isn't just about the number, but the chance that at least two share a birthday.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the probability of all birthdays being unique and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least two sharing. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the probability that all n birthdays are unique is 365/n multiplied by itself n times, which is (365/n)^n.

What is the probability that the values shown form a geometric sequence?\" Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when we roll three dice, each die has six possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6, which is 216. That's the denominator for my probability calculation. Now, the numerator will be the number of favorable outcomes where the three numbers rolled form a geometric sequence.\n\nAlright, so what is a geometric sequence? It's a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, right? So, if I have three terms a, b, c, then b = a \u00d7 r and c = b \u00d7 r. Therefore, c = a \u00d7 r\u00b2. So, for three numbers to form a geometric sequence, the ratio between the second and the first should be the same as the ratio between the third and the second.\n\nBut wait, since we're dealing with dice, each number can only be from 1 to 6. So, the possible values for a, b, c are integers between 1 and 6, inclusive. Also, since we're rolling three dice, the order matters, but in this case, since they are all being rolled together, the sequence is determined by the order they appear. Hmm, but does the order matter here? Because if I have numbers like 1, 2, 4, that's a geometric sequence with a ratio of 2, but if I have 4, 2, 1, that's a different sequence with a ratio of \u00bd.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a standard deck has 52 cards, and there are 4 aces in it. So, the deck is well-shuffled, meaning the aces are randomly distributed throughout the deck. I need to find the expected number of cards I need to draw before I get the first ace. \n\nI remember that in probability, the expectation can be calculated by summing up the probabilities of all possible outcomes multiplied by their respective values. But in this case, since we're dealing with the first occurrence, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me recall if there's a formula for the expectation of the position of the first ace. I think it might be related to the concept of geometric distribution, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. In a geometric distribution, the expected number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success. But in this case, the probability isn't constant because as we draw cards, the deck is changing, so the probability of drawing an ace changes as we go along.\n\nWait, so maybe geometric distribution isn't the right model here. Maybe I should think in terms of conditional expectation. That is, for each position in the deck, calculate the probability that the first ace is at that position and then sum over all positions multiplied by their position numbers. That sounds more complicated, but let's see.\n\nThere are 52 cards, so the first ace could be at position 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 52. Let me denote E as the expected value I need to find.

So, the problem is Alice and Bob are taking turns tossing a fair coin, and the first one to get heads wins. Alice goes first. I need to find the probability that Alice wins.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me think. It's a probability problem involving turns, which probably means it's a geometric series kind of situation. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first turn. Alice goes first. The probability that she gets heads on her first toss is 1/2, right? Because a fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads. If she gets heads, she wins immediately, so that's one scenario where she wins.\n\nBut if she doesn't get heads on her first toss, which also has a probability of 1/2, then it's Bob's turn. Bob then tosses the coin. The probability that Bob gets heads is also 1/2. If Bob gets heads, he wins, and Alice loses. But if Bob also gets tails, which is another 1/2 chance, then it's back to Alice for the next round.\n\nSo, essentially, the game can go on for multiple rounds. Let's think about the probability that Alice wins on her second turn. For that to happen, both Alice and Bob must have gotten tails in their first tosses, and then Alice gets heads. The probability of that happening is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Alice wins on her third turn would be both of them getting tails for two rounds and then Alice getting heads.

So, we have a jar that initially has 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles. That makes 20 marbles in total. The process is that we draw a marble, note its color, and then put it back into the jar along with another marble of the same color. So, after each draw, the total number of marbles in the jar remains 20, right? Because we take one out and then put two back.\n\nThe question is asking: what is the probability that after 10 such draws, there are 15 red marbles in the jar? Hmm, okay. So, we're supposed to find the probability that after 10 replacements, the number of red marbles has increased by 5.\n\nLet me think. Each time we draw a marble, the probability of drawing a red marble is 10/20, which is 1/2. Similarly, the probability of drawing a blue marble is also 1/2. After each draw, we replace the drawn marble with two marbles of the same color. So, if we draw a red marble, we put back two red marbles, effectively increasing the number of red marbles by one. If we draw a blue marble, we put back two blue marbles, so the number of blue marbles increases by one, and the number of red marbles stays the same.\n\nTherefore, each draw either increases the number of red marbles by one or leaves it unchanged.

What is the probability that exactly one bin remains empty? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have five balls and five bins. Each ball is placed into a bin randomly, and each bin is equally likely to be chosen for each ball. So, each ball has a 1/5 chance to go into any of the five bins. Now, we need to find the probability that exactly one bin remains empty after all five balls have been placed.\n\nOkay, so probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I should start by determining the total number of ways to distribute five balls into five bins. Since each ball has five choices, and the balls are independent, the total number of possible distributions is 5^5, right? Let me calculate that: 5*5*5*5*5 = 3125. So, there are 3125 possible ways to distribute the five balls into the five bins.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out how many of these distributions result in exactly one bin being empty. That is, four bins have at least one ball each, and one bin has no balls. So, I need to count the number of ways this can happen.\n\nHmm, how do I count the number of ways to have exactly one empty bin? Maybe I can think of it as choosing which bin is going to be empty and then distributing the five balls into the remaining four bins, making sure that each of those four bins has at least one ball.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Each shot has a 0.7 probability of hitting the target, and each shot is independent. I need to find the probability that the shooter hits the target at least 8 times. Hmm, okay. So, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of successes in multiple independent trials, the binomial probability formula is usually used. Yeah, binomial distribution. So, the probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials is given by the formula:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time, right? So, in this case, n is 10 shots, and k is the number of hits. The probability of success, p, is 0.7, and the probability of failure, which is not hitting the target, is 1 - p, so that's 0.3.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of hitting the target at least 8 times. That means I need to consider the probabilities of hitting exactly 8 times, exactly 9 times, and exactly 10 times. Then, I can add those probabilities together to get the total probability of hitting at least 8 times.\n\nSo, the formula for at least 8 hits would be:\n\nP(at least 8) = P(8) + P(9) + P(10)\n\nAlright, let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to compute P(8). So, plugging into the binomial formula:\n\nP(8) = C(10, 8) * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^(10-8)\n\nSimilarly, P(9) = C(10, 9) * (0.7",

Let's define the states based on the current lead that A has. So, if A is leading by 0 games, that's the starting state. If A is leading by 1 game, that's another state.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when we're dealing with probability, it's often helpful to figure out the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. The probability will then be the ratio of favorable to total outcomes.\n\nSo, the total number of three-digit numbers we can form by selecting three different digits from 1 to 9 without replacement. Since we're choosing without replacement, the order matters here because the number 123 is different from 321, for example. This sounds like a permutation problem.\n\nThe formula for permutations is P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. In this case, n is 9 (digits 1 through 9) and k is 3 (three-digit number). So, the total number of possible three-digit numbers is P(9,3). Let me calculate that.\n\nP(9,3) = 9! / (9 - 3)! = 9! / 6! = (9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6!) / 6! = 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 = 504. So, there are 504 different three-digit numbers we can form.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many of these numbers are divisible by 3.

It can be any number from 2 to 6 because if the largest number is 1, it can't be the largest since the other dice can't be smaller than 1. So, the largest number can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Hmm, this seems like a problem related to probability and expected value. I remember that for certain patterns, we can model this using Markov chains or recursion.

I need to find the probability that when I draw three marbles without replacement, all three are different colors. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that probability problems often involve figuring out the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to calculate two things: the total number of ways to draw three marbles from the bag, and the number of ways to draw three marbles where all are different colors.\n\nLet me start with the total number of possible outcomes. The bag has a total number of marbles. There are 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles. So, 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 marbles in total. \n\nTo find the total number of ways to draw three marbles from 12, I should use combinations because the order in which I draw the marbles doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. So, C(12, 3) is 12! / (3! * (12 - 3)!.\n\nCalculating that, 12! is 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9! but since we have 12 - 3 = 9 in the denominator, the 9! cancels out. So, it becomes (12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1). Let me compute that: 12 \u00d7 11 is 132, 132 \u00d7 10 is 1320. Then, 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 is 6. So, 1320 divided by 6 is ",

Hmm, so they're flipping a fair coin, which has a 50% chance of landing heads and 50% chance of landing tails on each toss. They take turns, Alice first. So, the first person to flip a tail wins.\n\nLet me think about how this game would play out. So, Alice flips first. She has a 50% chance of getting tails on her first flip. If she does, she wins immediately. If she gets heads, which is also a 50% chance, then it's Bob's turn. Bob then flips the coin. He has a 50% chance of getting tails, which would make him the winner, and 50% chance of getting heads, which would bring the game back to Alice.\n\nSo, it's like a recursive situation. Let's model this with probabilities. Let me denote P as the probability that the current player wins. Since Alice goes first, we can say that the probability that Alice wins on her first turn is 1/2. If she doesn't get tails (which is also 1/2 chance), then Bob gets to flip. Now, Bob has a 1/2 chance to win, but if he also doesn't get tails, then it's back to Alice, and the situation is just like it was at the beginning.\n\nSo, we can write an equation for P, the probability that the current player wins. Let's say P is the probability that the player whose turn it is wins. So, if it's Alice's turn, P is the probability that she wins.

Then, a random sample of 50 records is taken from this database. I need to find the probability that exactly 2 of those 50 records are corrupted. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving successes and failures without replacement, the binomial probability formula is usually useful. But wait, is this a binomial situation? Let me make sure. In a binomial distribution, we have a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes: success or failure. Here, taking a sample without replacement might complicate things because the trials aren't independent; the probability changes after each draw. So maybe I need to use the hypergeometric distribution instead. Yeah, that sounds right because hypergeometric is for successes and failures without replacement.\n\nAlright, so the hypergeometric distribution formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = (C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)) / C(N, n)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the population size, which is 1000 in this case.\n- K is the number of success states in the population, which are the corrupted records, so K = 10.\n- n is the number of draws, which is 50.\n- k is the number of observed successes, which is 2.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(X = 2) = (C(10, 2) * C(990, 48)) / C(1000, 50)\n\nWait, hold on.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. The test has 5 questions, each with 4 possible answers, and the student knows the answers to 2 of them. For the other 3 questions, the student has to guess. The question is asking for the probability that the student answers exactly 4 questions correctly. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. There are 5 questions total. For each question, there are 4 choices, so each question is an independent event with 1 correct answer and 3 incorrect ones. The student knows the correct answers to 2 questions, so for those 2, the probability of getting them right is 1, which is certain. For the remaining 3 questions, the student is guessing, so each of those has a 1/4 chance of being correct.\n\nSo, the student is answering 5 questions in total: 2 they know for sure, and 3 they guess. We need the probability that exactly 4 of these 5 are correct. That means the student must get all 2 known answers correct and exactly 2 out of the 3 guessed ones correct. Because if they get 2 correct on the guessed ones, and 2 + 2 = 4 correct in total.\n\nLet me break it down. The total number of questions is 5. The number of correct answers can be calculated by considering the known and guessed parts.

So, that would mean the buses come at 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45, and so on, right? But the catch is, a passenger arrives at the bus stop at a random time between 12:00 and 1:00. So, we need to find the expected waiting time for the next bus.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about expected value in probability. The expected value is like the average outcome we would expect if we could repeat the experiment many times. So, in this case, the \"experiment\" is a passenger arriving at a random time, and the outcome is the waiting time until the next bus arrives.\n\nFirst, let's model the arrival times of the buses. Since the buses come every 15 minutes starting at 12:00, their arrival times can be represented as a sequence: 0 minutes (12:00), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, and so on. So, if a passenger arrives at a random time between 0 and 60 minutes (which is 1:00), the waiting time until the next bus depends on when the passenger arrives.\n\nLet me visualize this.

I need to find the probability that exactly one box contains exactly two balls, and no box contains more than two balls. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the problem. There are ten identical balls and nine distinct boxes. Each ball is placed into a box randomly and independently, with each box having an equal probability. So, each ball has a 1/9 chance of going into any box, right?\n\nI need to find the probability that exactly one box has exactly two balls, and all the other boxes have either one ball or none. Hmm. So, no box can have more than two balls, and only one box has exactly two balls.

Since the balls are identical, this is a problem of distributing identical objects into distinct boxes with certain constraints. I remember that when dealing with identical objects, we can use the concept of partitions or multinomial coefficients.\n\nBut in this case, since the balls are identical, but the boxes are distinct, the number of ways to distribute the balls can be calculated using combinations. So, the total number of ways to distribute ten identical balls into nine distinct boxes is C(10 + 9 - 1, 9 - 1) = C(18,8). Wait, is that right?

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a four-digit PIN code means each digit can be from 0 to 9, and repetition is allowed. So, for each digit in the PIN, there are 10 possible choices. Since it's a four-digit code, that means we're looking at combinations with repetition.\n\nI remember something about permutations and combinations. But wait, in this case, since the order matters for a PIN, it's actually a permutation problem, right? Because the order of the digits matters in a PIN; 1234 is different from 4321. So, permutations with repetition.\n\nThe formula for permutations with repetition is n^k, where n is the number of things to choose from, and k is how many you choose. So here, n is 10 (digits 0-9) and k is 4 (the four-digit code). So, the total number of possible four-digit PINs would be 10^4.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10^4 is 10,000. So, there are 10,000 possible four-digit PINs. That makes sense because each digit has 10 options, and you have four digits, so 10*10*10*10.\n\nNow, the problem says a thief is trying four different PIN codes at random.

I want to figure out the probability that the first player has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a player to have a winning strategy. In combinatorial game theory, a position is called a winning position if the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nThis problem reminds me of the classic game of Nim, but with a slight difference.

I think the key here is to determine the losing positions, which are often referred to as P-positions (previous player can force a win) or losing positions, and the winning positions, which are N-positions (next player can force a win).\n\nLet me start by analyzing smaller cases and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's consider the base cases:\n\n- If there are 0 stones left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. Therefore, 0 is a losing position because the player whose turn it is can't make a move.\n\n- If there's 1 stone, the player can take it and win.

The question is, if we have two specific individuals in this group, what's the probability that they end up on the same team? Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem properly. We have 25 people total, and we need to split them into 5 teams of 5 each. So, essentially, it's like partitioning the group into subsets of 5. Now, we have two specific people, let's call them Person A and Person B. We want to find the probability that both A and B are in the same team.\n\nHmm, probability. So, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to divide the 25 people into teams such that A and B are together. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways to divide 25 people into 5 teams of 5 each.\n\nWait, hold on, how do we calculate the total number of ways to divide 25 people into 5 teams of 5? That seems a bit tricky. Let me recall. So, when dividing objects into groups of equal size, the formula is usually a multinomial coefficient. So, the total number of ways would be 25! divided by (5!^5) multiplied by 5! because the order of the teams doesn't matter. So, is that right? Let me think.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

The counterfeit coin is lighter than the real ones, and I only have a balance scale. I remember hearing something about this kind of problem before, maybe in a logic puzzle book or something. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. There are eight coins, and one is lighter. I need to find out which one it is using a balance scale. A balance scale can compare two groups of coins and tell me which side is heavier, lighter, or if they're equal. Since the counterfeit is lighter, if one side is lighter, that must be the side with the counterfeit. But if both sides are equal, then the counterfeit is in the remaining group.\n\nSo, the key is to divide the coins into groups and compare them. I think the best way is to divide them into three groups because three is a good number for balance scales.

So, in this case, instead of calculating the probability of matching exactly 4, 5, or 6 numbers, I can calculate the probability of matching fewer than 4 numbers and subtract that from 1.

Balls are drawn one at a time without replacement until all balls of one color have been drawn. I need to find the probability that the last ball drawn is red. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 3 red balls and 2 green balls in the urn. We're drawing them one by one without replacement, meaning once a ball is drawn, it can't go back into the urn. We stop drawing when all balls of one color have been drawn. So, we could stop when either all red balls are drawn or all green balls are drawn, whichever comes first.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the last ball drawn is red. That means that when we stop, the last ball drawn is red. So, that would imply that all the green balls have been drawn before the last red ball is drawn. Alternatively, if the last ball is red, that means we drew all green balls first, and then the last one is red.\n\nLet me think about how this could happen. Since there are 3 red and 2 green balls, the total number of balls is 5. So, the possible scenarios where the last ball is red would be if we draw both green balls first, and then the last red ball. Alternatively, is there another scenario where the last ball is red? Wait, maybe not just that. Because we could also have the last red ball drawn before all green balls are drawn, but that wouldn't make the last ball red. So, actually, the only way the last ball is red is if the last red ball is drawn after both green balls have been drawn.\n\nSo, to put it another way, the last red ball is the fifth draw, meaning that in the first four draws, we have drawn all three red balls except one,",

If she doesn't roll a 6, which is 5/6 chance, then Bob gets a turn. If Bob also doesn't roll a 6, which is another 5/6 chance, then it's Alice's turn again.

Similarly, the probability she wins on the third round is (5/6)^2*(5/6)^2*(1/6). Wait, that seems off.\n\nActually, each round consists of both Alice and Bob taking a turn.

If 7 individual socks are randomly selected, what is the probability of getting at least one matching pair? Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. So, let me start by understanding the problem clearly. There are 10 pairs of socks, which means there are 20 individual socks in total, right? Each pair is a different color, so each sock is unique in its color. Now, we are selecting 7 socks at random, and we need to find the probability that among these 7 socks, there is at least one pair that matches.\n\nHmm, when I hear \"at least one pair,\" my mind jumps to the complementary probability approach. Instead of calculating the probability of getting at least one pair directly, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract it from 1. The opposite of having at least one pair would be having no pairs at all, meaning all 7 socks are of different colors. So, if I can find the probability of selecting 7 socks with all different colors, subtract that from 1, and I should get the desired probability.\n\nOkay, so let me write that down:\n\nProbability(at least one pair) = 1 - Probability(all socks are different)\n\nThat makes sense. Now, I need to figure out how to compute Probability(all socks are different). To do this, I should think about how many ways there are to select 7 socks with all different colors and then divide that by the total number of ways to select any 7 socks from the drawer.\n\nSo, the total number of socks is 20, and we're choosing 7.

So, Person A is at the front, can see Persons B and C's hats. Person B can see only Person C's hat, and Person C can't see anyone. Each person has a 50-50 chance of wearing a red or blue hat.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I think this is a probability problem that involves waiting times or something like that. Maybe it's about the negative binomial distribution? I remember that the negative binomial distribution gives the probability of having a certain number of successes in a sequence of independent trials, where each trial has a probability of success. In this case, a \"success\" would be getting a head, right?\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the probability that the third head appears on the fifth flip, that means that in the first four flips, I must have gotten exactly two heads, and then the fifth flip is the third head. That makes sense because if I have two heads in the first four flips, then the fifth flip is the one that makes it three heads. So, the problem reduces to finding the probability of getting exactly two heads in the first four flips, and then multiplying that by the probability of getting a head on the fifth flip.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(3rd head on 5th flip) = P(exactly 2 heads in first 4 flips) * P(head on 5th flip)\n\nOkay, so now I need to find P(exactly 2 heads in first 4 flips). That sounds like a binomial probability. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k successes in n trials) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.

So, initially, the probability that I picked the car is 1/3, right? Because there's only one car among three doors.

So, the host is going to reveal a goat, but he has a choice between two doors to open. Wait, because if I initially picked the car, then the host can open either of the other two doors. But if I initially picked a goat, then the host has only one door with the car that he can open.\n\nSo, let me think about this.

When released, each dog independently finds the prey with probability 0.8. What is the probability that the prey is found if the hunter releases both dogs?\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out. So, the hunter has two dogs, and each dog has an 80% chance of finding the prey. I need to find the probability that at least one of them finds the prey. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I think this is a probability problem involving independent events. Since the two dogs are released independently, their probabilities don't affect each other. So, I should probably use the concept of independent probabilities.\n\nLet me recall, if two events are independent, the probability that both occur is the product of their individual probabilities. Similarly, the probability that either one occurs is calculated differently. I think it's 1 minus the probability that neither occurs. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, let me define the events. Let\u2019s say event A is the dog A finding the prey, and event B is dog B finding the prey. Both A and B have a probability of 0.8, and they are independent because the hunter releases both dogs, but each one's success doesn't affect the other's probability.\n\nSo, the probability that the prey is found is the probability that at least one of the dogs finds it. So, that would be P(A or B). I remember that for two events, P(A or B) is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the events are independent, P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B).

We have a total of 7 men and 5 women, so that's 12 people in total. We need to select 4 people for a committee, and we want the probability that there are more women than men on the committee. So, more women than men means that in the committee, there are 3 women and 1 man, or 4 women and 0 men. Because 4 is the size of the committee, right?

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probability problems, especially with multiple trials, it often involves combinations and factorials. Since the die is rolled 6 times, and each roll is independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6, right? Because each roll has 6 possibilities and there are 6 rolls. Let me calculate that: 6^6 is 6 multiplied by itself 6 times. So that's 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6.

Let me think.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probabilities involving multiple events where each event is independent, we often use combinations and probabilities multiplied together. Since the question is about birthdays, which are typically considered to have 365 possible days, I can assume that each student's birthday is independent and uniformly distributed among the 365 days.\n\nThe question is about the probability that at least 3 students share the same birthday. That means I need to calculate the probability that 3 or more students have the same birthday. Hmm, but calculating that directly might be complicated because there are many possibilities. Maybe it's easier to calculate the complementary probability instead\u2014that is, the probability that no three students share the same birthday. Then, subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\nYeah, that seems like a good approach.

Let me write that down:\n\nP(at least 3) = 1 - P(no three students share the same birthday)\n\nNow, how do I calculate P(no three students share the same birthday)?

What is the probability that at least one of the four aces is in the top 5 cards?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. So, the question is asking for the probability that when I shuffle a standard deck of 52 cards, at least one of the four aces is in the first five cards. That means I need to find the chance that one, two, three, or all four aces are among the top five cards. \n\nHmm, calculating the probability of multiple events like this can be complex because there are several possibilities. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or complementary probability. Wait, complementary probability is when you calculate the probability of the opposite event happening and subtract it from 1. That might be easier here.\n\nSo, let's think about the complementary event: what's the probability that none of the four aces are in the top five cards? If I can find that, then subtracting it from 1 will give me the probability that at least one ace is in the top five. That seems like a solid approach.\n\nAlright, so the complementary probability is that all four aces are in the bottom 47 cards. Because if they're not in the top five, they have to be somewhere else. So, how do I calculate that?\n\nWell, when dealing with probabilities involving specific positions in a shuffled deck, it's often useful to think in terms of combinations. Because the deck is shuffled randomly, each card has an equal chance of being in any position. So, the position of each card is equally likely.\n\nSo, let me model this.

Each player plays exactly one match against every other player, and each match results in one win and one loss\u2014no ties. The question is asking for the probability that exactly 3 players win exactly 4 matches each. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. In a round-robin tournament with 8 players, each player plays 7 matches because they play against every other player once. So, each player can have anywhere from 0 to 7 wins. The total number of matches in the tournament is C(8,2) which is 28 matches because each match is between two players. Since each match results in one win and one loss, the total number of wins across all players is 28.\n\nNow, the problem is about the probability that exactly 3 players have exactly 4 wins each. So, let's break this down. If 3 players have 4 wins each, that accounts for 3 * 4 = 12 wins. Since the total number of wins is 28, the remaining 28 - 12 = 16 wins must be distributed among the other 5 players. So, each of these 5 players can have some number of wins, but we need to figure out how they can be distributed.\n\nBut wait, each of these 5 players can't have more than 4 wins because if they did, that would mean one of the 3 players would have to have more than 4 wins to compensate, which isn't allowed. So, the remaining 16 wins must be distributed among 5 players, each having at most 4 wins. So, 16 divided by 5 is 3.2, so some of them will have 3 wins and some will have 4.

I need to find the probability that if I draw two balls at random without replacement, they are of different colors. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios tell us how parts relate to each other. So, if the ratio of red to blue to green is 2:3:5, that means for every 2 red balls, there are 3 blue and 5 green. To make this concrete, maybe I should find the total number of parts. Let's see, 2 + 3 + 5 is 10 parts. So, the total number of balls is 10 parts. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the actual number of balls, so I guess I can assume the total number of balls is 10 units? Or maybe 10 of each? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense because the ratio is 2:3:5. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the total number of balls is 2x + 3x + 5x, where x is a common multiplier. So, the total number of balls would be 10x. That makes more sense. But since the problem doesn't specify the total number, maybe it doesn't matter because we can work with ratios.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with probabilities of independent events, especially with multiple trials, I should think about the binomial probability formula. Each digit is like a Bernoulli trial, right? So, each digit has two possible outcomes, 0 or 1, with probabilities p and 1-p respectively. Since the code has 5 digits, and each is independent, the total number of possible codes is 2^5, which is 32. But we don't need all of them, just the number of codes with exactly 3 ones.\n\nSo, the number of codes with exactly 3 ones is given by the combination formula. Since the code has 5 digits, the number of ways to choose 3 positions to be 1s is C(5,3). Let me calculate that: 5 choose 3 is 10. So, there are 10 different codes with exactly 3 ones.\n\nEach of these codes has a probability of (p)^3 * (1-p)^2, because there are 3 ones and 2 zeros. Therefore, the probability of any specific code with exactly 3 ones is p^3*(1-p)^2.

So, the first time we turn over a heart could be on the first card, or the second, all the way up to the 13th card. I guess it could even be beyond that, but since there are only 13 hearts, the latest it could be is the 52nd card. But wait, actually, if the last card is a heart, then we have to turn over all 52 cards to find it. But is that really possible? No, actually, if the first 51 cards are not hearts, the last one has to be, so the maximum number of cards we'll turn over is 52. But that seems a bit high. Hmm, maybe not.

So, there's a box with 20 light bulbs, and 4 of them are defective. I need to find the probability that if I select 6 bulbs at random without replacement, exactly 2 of them are defective.\n\nHmm, okay. So, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step. First, I think I need to figure out the total number of ways to select 6 bulbs out of 20, regardless of whether they're defective or not. Then, I need to figure out how many of those selections include exactly 2 defective bulbs. Finally, I can divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 6 bulbs from 20 is a combination problem, right? Because the order in which I pick the bulbs doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number and k is the number we're choosing. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be C(20, 6).\n\nLet me calculate that: 20 choose 6. So, 20! divided by (6! * (20 - 6)!), which is 20! / (6! * 14!). I can simplify this because 20! is 20 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14!, so when I divide by 14!, those terms cancel out.

So, each toss doesn't affect the outcome of the previous one. A fair coin has two sides, heads and tails, each with a probability of 0.5. So, if we have 10 heads in a row already, does that change the probability of getting another head on the next toss?\n\nHmm, let me recall some probability concepts. I remember that in probability, if events are independent, the probability of multiple independent events happening is the product of their individual probabilities. But in this case, the next toss is also an independent event, so the fact that we've already had 10 heads in a row shouldn't affect the probability of the 11th toss.\n\nWait, but I also remember something about conditional probability. Maybe that's what's going on here. The question is asking for the probability that the next toss is heads given that we've already had 10 heads in a row. So, it's a conditional probability problem.\n\nLet me write down the formula for conditional probability. It's P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B), where A is the event that the next toss is heads, and B is the event that we've already had 10 heads in a row.\n\nSince each toss is independent, the probability of getting 10 heads in a row and then another head is just the product of the individual probabilities.

The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 5 numbers from 35. That's a combination problem, right? So, the total number of possible lottery tickets is C(35,5), which is calculated as 35! / (5! * (35-5)!).

I need to find the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease. \n\nFirst, let me recall what these terms mean. A false positive rate of 5% means that out of 100 people, 5 will test positive even though they don't have the disease. Similarly, a false negative rate of 2% means that 2 out of 100 people will test negative even though they do have the disease. \n\nSo, the disease prevalence is 3%, meaning 3 out of 100 people in the population actually have the disease. Now, the question is about the probability that someone who tests positive is actually a true positive. That is, given that they tested positive, what's the chance they actually have the disease?\n\nThis sounds like a conditional probability problem. I think I should use Bayes' Theorem here. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

What is the probability that Alice gets more heads than Bob?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nWait, so Alice flips a fair coin 8 times and Bob flips a fair coin 10 times. The question is asking for the probability that Alice gets more heads than Bob. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, both Alice and Bob are flipping fair coins, which means each flip has a 50% chance of being heads and 50% tails. So, the number of heads Alice gets can be modeled by a binomial distribution with parameters n=8 and p=0.5, and similarly for Bob, n=10 and p=0.5.\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that Alice gets more heads than Bob. So, we need to calculate the probability that Alice's number of heads, let's denote it as X, is greater than Bob's number of heads, which we can denote as Y. That is, P(X > Y).\n\nHmm, so to compute this, I think we can use the concept of joint probability. Since both X and Y are independent, the joint probability P(X > Y) can be calculated by summing over all possible values where X > Y. That is, we can write:\n\nP(X > Y) = \u03a3 [P(X = k) * P(Y = m)] for all k > m.\n\nWhere k ranges from 0 to 8 and m ranges from 0 to 10, but only when k > m. Since X can only go up to 8 and Y up to 10, the maximum k is 8, so when m is 0 to 8, k can be m+1 to 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without having to sum over all the possibilities. Let's see.\n\nI remember that for two independent binomial variables with the same p, there's a symmetry in their distribution.

How many handshakes take place in total?\" Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, when I hear \"group of 10 people,\" I think of a social gathering where each person can shake hands with others. But wait, when the question says \"everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once,\" I need to make sure I understand what that means. So, does it mean that each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once? That makes sense. So, for example, if I'm one person, I would shake hands with 9 others, right? Because in a group of 10, there are 9 other people to shake hands with.\n\nBut hold on, if I just think of it that way, maybe I can calculate the total number of handshakes by considering each person individually. So, each person shakes hands 9 times. If there are 10 people, then 10 times 9 handshakes. But wait, that would be 90. But hold on, that can't be right because that counts each handshake twice. For example, if person A shakes hands with person B, that's one handshake, not two. So, if I just multiply 10 by 9, I'm counting each handshake twice, once for each participant.\n\nSo, to correct for that, I need to divide by 2. So, 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 2 is 45.

The components are shipped in boxes of 200. What is the probability that a box contains at least one defective component?\n\nHmm, let's break this down. So, each component has a 0.5% chance of being defective. That means the probability that a single component is good is 99.5%, right? Because 100% minus 0.5% is 99.5%.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the probability that a box of 200 components has at least one defective component. Hmm, okay. So, when I see \"at least one,\" that makes me think about the complement rule in probability. Instead of calculating the probability of having one or more defects, which can get complicated with multiple cases, I can instead find the probability of the opposite event happening and subtract it from 1.\n\nSo, the opposite of having at least one defective component is having no defective components at all. That seems easier to calculate. If I can find the probability that all 200 components are good, then subtracting that from 1 will give me the probability of having at least one defective component.\n\nAlright, so the probability that one component is good is 0.995, as I figured out earlier. Since each component is independent, the probability that all 200 are good is the product of each individual probability. That is, 0.995 multiplied by itself 200 times. In mathematical terms, that would be 0.995^200.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(at least one defective) = 1 - P(no defectives) = 1 - (0.995)^200\n\nNow, I need to calculate (0.995)^200.

So, initially, there are 4 red and 6 blue marbles, which makes a total of 10 marbles. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the probability that the 5th marble drawn is red. I think the key here is to consider the possible sequences of draws that result in the 5th marble being red. Since we're dealing with probabilities, maybe I can use combinations or permutations to calculate this.\n\nLet me recall that probability can also be calculated by considering the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the sequences where the 5th marble is red, and the total outcomes are all possible sequences of 5 marbles drawn from the 10.\n\nWait, but how do I count the number of favorable sequences? Hmm, maybe I can think of it as choosing which marbles are drawn before the 5th draw and then drawing a red one on the 5th. So, if the 5th draw is red, that means out of the first four draws, we must have drawn 4 marbles, none of which are red? No, wait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, hold on.

What is the probability that one player gets all 13 cards of a single suit?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nWait, no. In bridge, each player is dealt 13 cards, but it's a four-player game. So, the total number of cards in the deck is 52, and each player gets 13. So, if one player is dealt all 13 of a suit, that means that the other three players must have none of those 13 cards. So, let's think about how that could happen.\n\nFirst, there are four suits in a deck: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. If one player is dealt all 13 hearts, for example, then the remaining 39 cards (since 52 - 13 = 39) are distributed among the other three players. So, each of the other players will have 13 cards, but none of them can have any hearts. So, effectively, the other three players must be dealt only from the remaining 39 cards, which are all clubs, diamonds, and spades.\n\nBut wait, each of the other three players must have 13 cards each, and the total number of non-heart cards is 39, which is exactly 13 times 3. So, that means that the other three players each get exactly 13 non-heart cards. So, the probability that one specific player gets all 13 cards of a particular suit is equal to the probability that all 13 cards of one suit go to one player.\n\nSo, how do we calculate that probability?\n\nFirst, let's fix on a specific suit, say hearts. The total number of ways to deal the 52 cards to four players is the number of ways to partition the deck into four hands of 13 cards each. That's a multinomial coefficient: 52! divided by (13!^4). But since the order of the players doesn't matter, we can think of it as 52 choose 13, then 39 choose 13, and so on, but it's the same as the multinomial",

I need to figure out the expected number of bulbs I have to pick before I find the first defective one. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when we're dealing with probabilities involving expected values, sometimes it's helpful to use indicator variables or maybe the concept of geometric distribution. But wait, in this case, the probability isn't constant like in a geometric distribution where each trial has the same probability. Here, the probability changes because the number of defective bulbs decreases as we pick more bulbs.\n\nLet me clarify: the problem is about the expected number of trials needed to find the first defective bulb when drawing without replacement from a finite population. So, unlike drawing with replacement, each time we pick a bulb, we don't put it back, so the probability changes each time.\n\nOkay, so the box starts with 100 bulbs, 10 defective and 90 good. The first time I pick a bulb, the probability of picking a defective one is 10/100, which is 0.1. If I pick a good bulb, then the next probability becomes 10/99, since there are now 99 bulbs left, 10 of which are defective. Then, if I pick another good bulb, it's 10/98, and so on.\n\nSo, the expectation here is going to be the sum of the expected number of trials for each step.

The person who takes the last stick wins. Alice goes first. I need to figure out the probability that Alice will win if both play optimally. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I remember that these kinds of games are called Nim games, right? And in Nim games, the key is to figure out winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nSo, since the game starts with 15 sticks, we need to determine if 15 is a winning or losing position. If it's a winning position, Alice has a strategy to win; if it's a losing position, Bob can win if both play optimally.\n\nLet me recall the concept of Grundy numbers or something similar. In Nim games, the Grundy number for a heap of size n is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers for the positions reachable from n. The mex is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set of Grundy numbers for the next possible moves.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to calculate all Grundy numbers from 0 to 15. Instead, maybe I can use the fact that in this specific case, since each move allows taking 1, 2, or 3 sticks, the losing positions occur periodically. I think the losing positions are at numbers that are multiples of 4. Let me test this idea.\n\nLet's consider smaller numbers and see if I can find a pattern.\n\n- If there are 0 sticks left, the game is over, so that's a losing position because the player who just moved took the last stick, but wait, actually",

Player A has a 0.7 chance of making each shot, and player B has a 0.8 chance. Each of them takes n shots. I need to find the probability that they make the same number of shots. Hmm, okay, so I think this is a probability problem involving two binomial distributions. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a binomial distribution is. It's a probability distribution that gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent trials, where each trial has a success probability of p. So, for player A, the probability of making exactly k shots out of n is given by the binomial formula: C(n, k) * (0.7)^k * (1 - 0.7)^(n - k). Similarly, for player B, it's C(n, k) * (0.8)^k * (1 - 0.8)^(n - k). \n\nSince we want the probability that both players make the same number of shots, we need to consider the probability that both make k shots, for k from 0 to n, and then sum all those probabilities. So, the total probability P is the sum from k = 0 to n of [C(n, k) * (0.7)^k * (0.3)^(n - k) * C(n, k) * (0.8)^k * (0.2)^(n - k)]. \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me write that down more neatly:\n\nP = \u03a3 [C(n, k) * (0.7)^k * (0.3)^(n - k) * C(n, k) * (0.8)^k * (0.2)^(n - k)] for k = 0 to n",
