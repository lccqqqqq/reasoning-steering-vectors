Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that odd and even numbers have specific definitions, so maybe I can start from there.\n\nFirst, let me recall: an integer is even if it's divisible by 2, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. On the other hand, if n is odd, then it can be written as n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Got that down.\n\nNow, the problem says that n squared is odd. So, n\u00b2 is odd. I need to show that if n\u00b2 is odd, then n must be odd. That seems like a one-directional proof, so maybe I should assume the opposite and reach a contradiction or use some properties of squares.\n\nWait, actually, it might be easier to use the definitions directly. Let me try that. Let's suppose that n is even. Then n = 2k for some integer k. Then, n squared would be (2k)\u00b2, which is 4k\u00b2. Hmm, 4k\u00b2 is clearly even because it's divisible by 2. But the problem states that n\u00b2 is odd, so that can't be. Therefore, our assumption that n is even must be wrong. Therefore, n must be odd.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should consider the converse or other cases. Wait, no, the problem is only asking one way: if n\u00b2 is odd, then n is odd. So, the converse is different, which would be if n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd. That's probably true too, but the question isn't asking that.\n\nLet me think about another approach just to verify. Maybe using modular arithmetic? So",

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that in logic, an implication is a statement where if one thing is true, then another thing must be true. It's like, if I say, \"If it rains, then I will stay home,\" that means that whenever it rains, I do stay home.

So, if P is false, even if Q is also false, the implication holds.\n\nLet me think of an example to visualize this.

Hmm, I remember that a proof by contradiction is where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that it leads to a contradiction. So, if I want to prove that sqrt(2) is irrational, I should start by assuming that it's rational. That seems like a good starting point.\n\nAlright, let me write that down. Let's say sqrt(2) is equal to some fraction a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1. That is, the fraction is in its simplest form. So, sqrt(2) = a/b, and both a and b are in their lowest terms, meaning they can't be simplified further.\n\nNow, if I square both sides of the equation, I get 2 = a\u00b2 / b\u00b2. That means 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2. So, a\u00b2 equals 2b\u00b2. Hmm, if a\u00b2 is equal to 2b\u00b2, then a must be divisible by 2, right? Because 2b\u00b2 is obviously divisible by 2, so a has to be divisible by 2 as well. Let me write that down: a = 2k, where k is some integer.\n\nIf I substitute a back into the equation 2b\u00b2 = a\u00b2, I get 2b\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2, which simplifies to 2b\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2.

Hmm, that sounds like it's about the transitivity of subset relations. I remember that in set theory, the subset relation is supposed to be transitive, but I need to actually prove it, not just state it.\n\nLet me start by recalling what it means for one set to be a subset of another. So, if A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is also in B. Similarly, if B is a subset of C, every element in B is also in C. So, combining these two, it should follow that every element in A is also in C. Is that right?\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's denote the elements of sets using variables because that might make it easier to visualize. Let x be an arbitrary element of A. Since A is a subset of B, by definition, x must also be an element of B. So, x \u2208 A implies x \u2208 B.\n\nNow, since B is a subset of C, any element that is in B must also be in C. That means, if x is in B, then x is in C. So, from the first part, we have x \u2208 B, and from the second part, x \u2208 C. Therefore, combining these two, x must be in both A and C. \n\nWait, but does that mean every element of A is in C? Yes, because I took an arbitrary element x of A and showed it's also in C.

Hmm, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works.\n\nFirst, I remember that induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the statement holds true for n = 1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k and then show it must also be true for k + 1.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. When n = 1, the series becomes just 1. Plugging into the formula, n(3n - 1)/2 would be 1*(3*1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, the base case checks out because both sides equal 1. Good, that works.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let's assume that the formula works for n = k. That is, assume that 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) = k(3k - 1)/2. This is our induction hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that if this holds for n = k, then it must also hold for n = k + 1. That means I need to show that 1 + 4 + 7 + ... + (3k - 2) + (3(k + 1) - 2) equals (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1)/2.\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, (k + 1)(3k + 3 -",

Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem. The question suggests using mathematical induction, so I should probably start by recalling how induction works.\n\nFirst, I remember that mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you show that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually n = 1. Then, the inductive step is where you assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k and then show it must also be true for k + 1.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. Let me plug in n = 1 into the expression n\u00b3 - n. That would be 1\u00b3 - 1, which is 1 - 1 = 0. Now, is 0 divisible by 3? Well, yes, because 0 divided by any non-zero number is 0, which is an integer. So the base case works out.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let me denote the statement as P(n): n\u00b3 - n is divisible by 3. I need to show that if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) must also be true. So, assuming P(k) is true, that means k\u00b3 - k is divisible by 3. In other words, k\u00b3 - k = 3m for some integer m.\n\nNow, I need to show that (k + 1)\u00b3 - (k + 1) is also divisible by 3. Let me expand (k + 1)\u00b3. I remember the formula for expanding a cube of a binomial: (a + b)\u00b3 = a\u00b3 + 3a\u00b2b + 3ab\u00b2 + b\u00b3. Applying that here, (k + 1)",

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, primes are like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. The question is, are there infinitely many of them? I've heard before that this is an open question in mathematics, but I think it's been proven, right? Yeah, I think Euclid did something like this a long time ago.\n\nWait, how did Euclid approach it? I think he assumed the opposite of what we want to prove and then reached a contradiction. So, if I want to prove there are infinitely many primes, I can start by assuming the opposite: that there are only finitely many primes. Let me write that down.\n\nLet's say the primes are p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, ..., p\u2099. So, there are only n primes. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then my assumption is wrong, meaning there must be infinitely many primes.\n\nOkay, how do I get a contradiction?

Hmm, that sounds like a classic logical implication chain. I remember in school, my teacher mentioned something about hypothetical syllogism. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand what each statement means. If P implies Q, that means whenever P is true, Q must also be true. Similarly, if Q implies R, then whenever Q is true, R must be true. So, if we start with P, which leads to Q, and then Q leads to R, then P should lead to R.

There are three variables, so there are 8 possible combinations.\n\nBut wait, do I really need a truth table for this? It might get a bit messy, but it's a reliable method. Alternatively, I can use natural deduction or maybe use the definition of implication. Let me try both methods and see which one is more straightforward.\n\nStarting with natural deduction. I remember that in natural deduction, we have rules for introducing and eliminating implications.

So maybe I should check n=5 first. Let me calculate 2\u2075 and 5\u00b2. 2\u2075 is 32, and 5\u00b2 is 25. So, 32 > 25, which is true. That's good for the base case.\n\nNow, the inductive step.

From the induction hypothesis, I know that 2\u1d4f > k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, 2 * 2\u1d4f > 2 * k\u00b2. Therefore, 2^(k+1) > 2k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to compare 2k\u00b2 with (k+1)\u00b2.

So, P(x) implies Q(x) is like A implies B, and Q(x) implies R(x) is like B implies C. So, putting them together, by hypothetical syllogism, P(x) should imply R(x).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should write this out more formally. So, let's consider the given premises:\n\n1. For all x, P(x) \u2192 Q(x). Let's call this premise (1).\n2. For all x, Q(x) \u2192 R(x). Let's call this premise (2).\n\nAnd we need to prove that for all x, P(x) \u2192 R(x). Let's call this conclusion (3).\n\nIn natural deduction, we can approach this by assuming P(x) and then deriving R(x). So, let's try that.\n\nAssume P(x). From premise (1), since P(x) implies Q(x), we can derive Q(x). So, we have Q(x). Now, from premise (2), Q(x) implies R(x), so with Q(x), we can derive R(x). Therefore, from our assumption of P(x), we've derived R(x). So, P(x) implies R(x), which is what we wanted to prove. So,",

Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that integers are numbers like ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3... and so on. So, odd integers are numbers like -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, etc., which can be written as 2k + 1 where k is an integer. Similarly, even integers are numbers like -2, 0, 2, 4, which can be written as 2k where k is an integer. \n\nSo, if I take an odd integer, let's call it 'a', which is 2k + 1, and an even integer, let's call it 'b', which is 2m, where k and m are integers. Then, I need to find the sum a + b. \n\nLet me write that out: a + b = (2k + 1) + 2m. Hmm, let's simplify that. Combine like terms: 2k + 2m is 2(k + m), so the expression becomes 2(k + m) + 1. That's the same as 2 times some integer (since k + m is an integer) plus 1. \n\nNow, 2 times an integer is always even, right? Because multiplying any integer by 2 gives an even number. And then we add 1 to that. So, an even number plus 1 is odd. Therefore, the sum a + b is odd. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.

On the other hand, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) would be all elements that are in both A and B, or in both A and C. \n\nHmm, are these two sets the same?

So, the structure here seems to fit that.\n\nThe statement is of the form: If P, then Q. P is \"I go to the mall,\" and Q is \"I buy new shoes.\" So, the first premise is P \u2192 Q. The second premise is \u00acQ, meaning I did not buy new shoes. Then the conclusion is \u00acP, meaning I did not go to the mall.\n\nSo, applying modus tollens, if we have P \u2192 Q, and \u00acQ, then we can infer \u00acP. That seems to be exactly what's happening here. Therefore, by modus tollens, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nWait, but sometimes I get confused about the rules. Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Modus tollens is about denying the consequent, right? So if the consequent isn't true, the antecedent must not be true. Yeah, that's it.\n\nI don't see any issues here. The structure is straightforward. The first statement is a conditional, the second is the negation of the consequent, and the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent. So, the argument is correctly applying modus tollens.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is using truth tables. If I construct a truth table, I can see all possible combinations.

So, the whole expression is like (A \u2192 B), where A is (P \u2192 Q) and B is (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). \n\nI know that an implication A \u2192 B is only false when A is true and B is false.

Hmm, let me think about how to prove that. I remember that even and odd numbers have specific definitions, so maybe I can use that. \n\nFirst, let me recall: an even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. So, if a number is even, it can be written as 2 times some integer.

So, if I have two consecutive integers, I can call them n and n+1, where n is any integer.

A set A is a subset of B, written as A \u2286 B, if every element of A is also an element of B. So, for all x, if x is in A, then x is in B. Now, what does A \u2229 B mean? The intersection of A and B is the set of all elements that are in both A and B. So, A \u2229 B = {x | x \u2208 A and x \u2208 B}.\n\nGiven that A is a subset of B, that means every element in A is already in B. Therefore, when we take the intersection, we're looking for elements that are in both A and B. But since all elements of A are already in B, every element that's in A is automatically in B as well. So, the set of elements common to both A and B should just be A itself.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me think of an example to test this. Suppose A is {1, 2} and B is {1, 2, 3}. Then A is a subset of B because all elements of A are in B. The intersection A \u2229 B would be {1, 2}, which is equal to A. Another example: if A is the empty set, which is a subset of every set, then A \u2229 B should also be the empty set, which is equal to A. If A has no elements, their intersection is also empty. That still holds.\n\nBut what",

Hmm, induction. Let me remember how mathematical induction works. It's like, you prove the base case, then assume it's true for some integer k, and then prove it for k+1. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nFirst, the base case. Let me start with n=1. So, 4^1 - 1 is 4 - 1, which is 3. Is 3 divisible by 3? Yes, because 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, the base case holds.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a positive integer n. When we square it, n\u00b2, the result is divisible by 4. I need to show that n itself must be divisible by 2. So, in other words, if 4 divides n\u00b2, then 2 divides n. That seems straightforward, but I need to prove it, not just state it.\n\nAlright, let's recall some number theory concepts. Divisibility by 4 and 2.

Hmm, induction seems a bit tricky for me, but I'll give it a try. Let me recall how induction works. From what I remember, induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is like verifying that the statement holds true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step assumes that it's true for some arbitrary natural number k and then proves it must also be true for k+1.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. So, for n=1, the first odd natural number is 1. The sum of the first odd natural number is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 equals 1, which checks out. That seems straightforward. So the base case is done.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, the sum of the first k odd natural numbers is k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. Got that. Now, I have to show that if this is true for k, then it must also be true for k+1.\n\nAlright, let's write that out.

So, if I can show that \u221a3 cannot be written as a simple fraction like a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero, then it must be irrational.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a number to be rational.

Hmm, I remember something about set operations from my discrete math class. Let me try to recall the definitions.\n\nFirst, the union of two sets A and B, denoted as A \u222a B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. The intersection of A and B, denoted A \u2229 B, is the set of all elements that are in both A and B. Okay, so for the union part, A \u222a \u2205 should include all elements that are in A or in the empty set. But wait, the empty set has no elements, right? So does that mean A \u222a \u2205 is just A? That seems to make sense because adding nothing to A shouldn't change it.\n\nLet me think about how to prove this formally. Maybe I can use the definition of union. For any element x, x is in A \u222a \u2205 if x is in A or x is in \u2205. But since \u2205 has no elements, the only way x can be in A \u222a \u2205 is if x is in A. Therefore, every element of A \u222a \u2205 is in A, so A \u222a \u2205 must be a subset of A. Also, A is a subset of A \u222a \u2205 because every element of A is also in A \u222a \u2205. Therefore, A \u222a \u2205 must equal A.

Hmm, that sounds like it's related to prime factorization. I remember from my math classes that any integer can be broken down into prime numbers, but I need to figure out how to prove it using strong induction.\n\nLet me start by recalling what strong induction is. Strong induction has two steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually the starting point, like proving it's true for the first few numbers, and then the inductive step assumes it's true for all numbers up to a certain point and then proves it for the next one.\n\nSo, first, the base case. Let me think about the smallest integers greater than 1. That would be 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. I know that 2 is a prime number, so its only factors are 1 and itself. So, 2 can be written as 2, which is a prime. Similarly, 3 is also prime, so it can be written as 3. 4 is not prime because it can be divided by 2, so it's 2 times 2, which are both primes. 5 is prime, so it's just 5. 6 is 2 times 3, both primes. 7 is prime, 8 is 2 times 2 times 2, and so on. So, the base cases seem to hold because either the number is prime itself or it can be broken down into smaller primes. So, I think the base case is okay.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that every integer less than some number n can be written as a product of primes, and then show that n itself can also be written as a product of primes. Wait, but the statement is that every integer greater than 1 can be written",

Because a\u00b2 = 3b\u00b2 implies a = sqrt(3) * b. But sqrt(3) is irrational, isn't it? Because 3 isn't a perfect square.\n\nSo, if a is equal to sqrt(3) times b, and b is an integer, then a would have to be irrational unless b is zero.

Plugging into the formula, 1*(1+1)/2, which is 2/2, which is 1. That checks out. So, base case is good.\n\nNow, the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. That's my induction hypothesis. Now, I need to show that if this holds, then it must also hold for k+1, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nOkay, so starting from the left side: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). I can take the sum up to k, which is k(k+1)/2, and then add (k+1) to it. So, that would be k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Hmm, let me write that down: k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Maybe I can factor out (k+1) from both terms. Let's see, (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can combine the terms over a common denominator. So, k(k+1)/2 + (k",

Hmm, okay. I think induction might be a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's usually two steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case, which is typically n=1. Let me plug in n=1 into the expression \\(4^1 - 1\\).

Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with divisibility by 3, sometimes considering the possible remainders when numbers are divided by 3 can help. Maybe I can use modular arithmetic or something like that.\n\nFirst, let me think about the expression n\u00b3 + 2n. I want to show that this is divisible by 3, which means that n\u00b3 + 2n should be congruent to 0 modulo 3. So, in other words, n\u00b3 + 2n \u2261 0 mod 3. If I can show that for any integer n, this congruence holds, then I'm done.\n\nSince modular arithmetic works by looking at remainders when divided by a number\u2014in this case, 3\u2014it might be helpful to consider all possible cases of n modulo 3. That is, n can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. I'll check each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Suppose n \u2261 0 mod 3. That means n is a multiple of 3, so n = 3k for some integer k. Then, plugging into the expression, n\u00b3 + 2n = (3k)\u00b3 + 2*(3k) = 27k\u00b3 + 6k. Both terms are multiples of 3, so their sum is also a multiple of 3. Therefore, in this case, n\u00b3 + 2n is divisible by 3.\n\nCase 2: Suppose n \u2261 1 mod 3. Then, n can be written as 3k + 1 for some integer k. Let's compute n\u00b3 + 2n. \n\nFirst, n\u00b3: (3k + 1)\u00b3. Expanding this, it's 27k",
