How many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here: A cube is painted red on all faces, then cut into 27 equal smaller cubes. How many of these smaller cubes have exactly 2 red faces? Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cube. It's a big cube, right? And it's painted red on all its faces. So, if I imagine the cube, all six faces\u2014front, back, left, right, top, bottom\u2014are all painted red. Now, the cube is then cut into 27 smaller cubes. Since 27 is 3 cubed, that means it's divided into 3 parts along each dimension\u2014length, width, and height. So, each edge of the big cube is split into three equal smaller segments, making 3 smaller cubes along each edge.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many of these small cubes have exactly two red faces. Hmm. So, I need to figure out which of these smaller cubes have exactly two of their faces painted red. Let me think about the structure of the cube.\n\nIn a cube, the smaller cubes can be categorized based on their positions: corner cubes, edge cubes, face cubes, and inner cubes. The corner cubes have three red faces, the edge cubes (but not corners) have two red faces, the face cubes (but not edges or corners) have one red face, and the inner cubes have no red faces.\n\nSo, the ones with exactly two red faces are the edge cubes. But wait, in the big cube, each edge has a certain number of smaller cubes. Since the big cube is divided into three smaller cubes along each edge, each edge will have three smaller cubes. But the two in the middle of each edge are the edge cubes, right? Because the ones at the ends are the corners, which have three red faces.\n\nSo, each edge has two smaller cubes with exactly two red faces.",

Hmm, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I have a square piece of paper. Let me imagine it as a standard square, maybe 8.5 by 8.5 inches or something. Doesn't really matter the size because the shape is what's important. So, the first instruction is to fold it in half vertically. Okay, vertical fold\u2014so if I have the square in front of me, folding it vertically would mean bringing the left and right edges together. So, after the first fold, the paper is now a rectangle, half as wide as before. So, if it was, say, 8.5 inches wide, now it's 4.25 inches wide, right? And the height remains the same, 8.5 inches.\n\nNext, I need to fold it in half horizontally. Wait, horizontal fold\u2014so that would bring the top and bottom edges together. So, if I have the folded rectangle in my hands, folding it horizontally would mean folding it along the vertical midline. So now, the paper is a quarter of its original size in area, but still a rectangle, now 4.25 inches by 4.25 inches. So, it's a square again, but smaller.\n\nNow, the next step is to cut off the corner where all the folds meet. Hmm, okay. So, after the two folds, the paper is folded into a smaller square, but where exactly is the corner? Let me think. When you fold vertically and then horizontally, the corner that's being referred to must be the corner that's opposite the original corner after both folds.

Hmm, cross-sections of prisms, right? I remember that a cross-section is the shape you get when you slice through a 3D object with a plane, and the area depends on the angle at which you slice it. So, the maximum area should be when the plane is cutting through in a way that perhaps is most \"exposed,\" but I'm not exactly sure how to calculate that.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangular prism.

Now, when you slice through it with a plane, the cross-section could be a triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, or hexagon, depending on how the plane intersects the prism. But I think the maximum area cross-section would be a triangle, maybe? Or perhaps a rectangle?\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, the maximum cross-sectional area should be the largest possible flat shape that can fit within the prism. Since the prism is 3D, the largest cross-section would actually be the face with the largest area. So, maybe the largest face is the one with sides 4 and 5, which would have an area of 20? But no, wait, that's just the face, but the problem says a cross-section, which is created by a plane. So, perhaps the cross-section can be larger than the face?

If it's a straight line of four cubes, the front view would be a square only if each cube is viewed from the front, which would just be a square. But the right view is also a square. So maybe it's not a straight line.\n\nWait, maybe it's arranged in a 2x2 square, but that would make the front view a square, the right view a square, and the top view a square as well. But the top view is supposed to be a rectangle with length four times its width. So that doesn't fit. So maybe it's not 2x2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's arranged in an L-shape? Let me think.

I need to figure out what shape this new figure becomes and how many faces it has. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me get a clear picture of a cube in my mind. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces. Each edge is the same length, right? Now, the problem says to slice off each corner by cutting along planes that pass through points that divide each edge in a 1:2 ratio. So, that means on each edge, which is 3 units long if we consider the cube with edges of length 3 for simplicity, the division point would be at 1 unit from one end and 2 units from the other. Wait, actually, the ratio is 1:2, so it could be either way. But since we're talking about slicing off the corners, I think it's the point closer to the corner that we're considering. So, each edge is divided into segments of 1 and 2 units, and the cut is made at the 1 unit mark from each corner.\n\nSo, for each corner, which is a vertex of the cube, we're going to make a cut that goes through the point that's 1/3 of the way along each edge from that vertex. That makes sense. So, each cut is a plane that intersects three edges meeting at a corner, each at 1/3 of their length from the corner.

The cone has a height of 12 cm and a base radius of 5 cm. A plane is cutting the cone parallel to the base at a height of 8 cm from the base. I need to find the radius of the circular cross-section created by this cut. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of cones. A right circular cone has a circular base and a height perpendicular to the base from the apex (the tip). The radius of the base is given as 5 cm, and the height is 12 cm. Now, a plane cutting the cone parallel to the base will create a smaller, similar cone on top and a frustum below it. But since the problem is asking about the radius of the cross-section, which is the base of the smaller cone, right?\n\nWait, actually, no. When a plane cuts the cone parallel to the base, the cross-section created is a circle, and that circle will have a radius smaller than the original base because it's higher up the cone. So, I think I need to find the radius of that smaller circle.\n\nSince the plane is cutting the cone 8 cm from the base, that means the height from the base to the plane is 8 cm. But the total height of the cone is 12 cm, so the distance from the plane to the apex of the cone must be 12 cm minus 8 cm, which is 4 cm. So, the smaller cone that's cut off has a height of 4 cm, and the original cone has a height of 12 cm.\n\nI remember that for similar solids, the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions is equal.

The other three faces are isosceles triangles, so each of those has two sides that are equal, and those sides are 8 cm each.

What is the volume of the resulting solid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where there's a square with a side length of 6 units, and it's being rotated around one of its diagonals. I need to find the volume of the resulting solid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, visualizing the problem might help. If I have a square, and I rotate it around one of its diagonals, the shape that is formed is actually a three-dimensional object. I remember that when you rotate a shape around an axis, it creates a solid of revolution. In this case, since it's a square, the resulting solid is probably some sort of double cone or maybe a more complex shape. Let me try to figure it out.\n\nSo, let's break it down. A square has four sides, each of length 6 units. The diagonal of the square is important here because that's the axis around which we're rotating. I should calculate the length of the diagonal first. The formula for the diagonal (d) of a square with side length (a) is d = a\u221a2. So, plugging in the value, we get d = 6\u221a2. That makes sense because in a square, the diagonal splits it into two right-angled triangles, each with legs of length 6. Using Pythagoras theorem, the hypotenuse (diagonal) is \u221a(6\u00b2 + 6\u00b2) = \u221a72 = 6\u221a2. Got that.\n\nNow, when the square is rotated around this diagonal, each vertex not on the diagonal will trace out a circle, creating a three-dimensional shape. I think this shape is called a double cone or bicone. It's like two cones attached at their bases. To confirm, if I imagine the square rotating around its diagonal, the two opposite vertices not on the axis of rotation will each trace out a circle, forming the tips of two cones. The other two vertices lie on the axis of rotation",

I need to find the volume of the remaining solid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cube. A cube has all edges equal, so each edge is 10 cm. When a corner is cut off, it's like truncating the corner, and the shape that's cut off is a smaller polyhedron. Since the cut creates an equilateral triangle, that suggests that the cut is made in such a way that all three edges meeting at that corner are being cut at the same point, forming an equilateral triangle face.\n\nWait, no, actually, if you cut off a corner with a plane, the face created is a triangle, but it's not necessarily equilateral unless the lengths of the cuts on each edge are equal. So, the plane intersects each of the three edges meeting at the corner, and those intersection points must be equidistant from the corner. That way, the triangle formed is equilateral.\n\nSo, let's denote the corner being cut off as vertex A, and the three edges meeting at A as AB, AC, and AD, each of length 10 cm. Let's say we cut off a small tetrahedron from the corner A. The plane will intersect each of these edges at some point, say, B', C', and D'. The distances from A to B', A to C', and A to D' must be equal for the triangle B'C'D' to be equilateral.\n\nLet me denote the distance from A to each of these points as x. So, AB' = AC' = AD' = x.

Hmm, let me think about what a regular octahedron is. It's one of the Platonic solids, right? It has 8 triangular faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. Each face is an equilateral triangle. \n\nSince it's regular, all the edges are the same length, and all the faces are congruent. So, if I can figure out the length of one edge, I can find the area of one face and then multiply by 8 to get the total surface area.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the distance from any vertex to the center is 5 units. I think this distance is called the radius of the circumscribed sphere or the circumradius. So, if I can find the edge length using the circumradius, then I can compute the surface area.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the circumradius (R) of a regular octahedron in terms of its edge length (a). I remember that for a regular octahedron, the circumradius is given by R = (a * sqrt(2)) / 2. Let me verify that. So, if R is 5, then 5 = (a * sqrt(2)) / 2. Solving for a, I get a = (5 * 2) / sqrt(2) = 10 / sqrt(2). Rationalizing the denominator, that's (10 * sqrt(2)) / 2 = 5 * sqrt(2).

The small cube has a side length of 2 cm, and the larger one has a side length of 8 cm. They say the small cube is placed such that corresponding faces are parallel and their centers coincide. Then, the space between them is filled with water, and I need to find the volume of that water. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I know that the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed. So, the volume of the larger cube should be 8 cm times 8 cm times 8 cm. Let me write that down: 8\u00b3. 8 times 8 is 64, and 64 times 8 is 512. So, the volume of the large cube is 512 cubic centimeters.

I need to figure out which one has the highest surface area to volume ratio. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the surface area to volume ratio is a measure of how \"exposed\" a shape is. A shape with a high ratio would mean it has a lot of surface area compared to its volume, so it's less compact. On the other hand, a low ratio would mean it's more compact, like a sphere, which is the most efficient in terms of volume for a given surface area.\n\nBut wait, the question says all these shapes have the same volume. So even though the sphere is the most efficient in terms of volume for a given surface area, here they all have the same volume. So maybe among these, the one that isn't as compact as a sphere could have a higher surface area to volume ratio.\n\nLet me recall the formulas for surface area and volume for each shape.\n\nStarting with the cube. A cube has 6 faces, each face is a square with area equal to the square of its edge length, say 'a'. So surface area is 6a\u00b2. The volume of a cube is a\u00b3. So the ratio would be 6a\u00b2 / a\u00b3, which simplifies to 6/a.\n\nFor the sphere, the surface area is 4\u03c0r\u00b2, and the volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. So the ratio is 4\u03c0r\u00b2 / (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Simplifying that, the \u03c0 cancels out, and we have 3/r. So the sphere's ratio is 3/r.\n\nNext, the regular tetrahed",

It says the angle between any lateral face and the base. So, I think this is referring to the dihedral angle between the lateral face and the base. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, so in this case, the angle between one of the triangular faces and the square base.\n\nI remember that to find a dihedral angle, we can use some geometry. Maybe I can find it by considering the height of the pyramid and the base edge, or perhaps by using some trigonometric relationships.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the dihedral angle. I think it involves the height of the pyramid, the base edge, and maybe the slant height? Or perhaps I need to use some right triangles.\n\nWait, maybe I should draw a diagram to help me visualize. So, if I imagine the pyramid, the base is a square with sides 10 cm. The height is 12 cm, so the apex is 12 cm above the center of the square.\n\nNow, the dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base.

I need to find the radius of the sphere. Hmm, let me visualize this. A cylinder inside a sphere, touching it at the top and bottom. So, the cylinder isn't floating in the middle; it's perfectly snug, right? That probably means the center of the sphere is aligned with the center of the cylinder. \n\nAlright, let's think about the dimensions. The cylinder has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm. So, the height of the cylinder is 8 cm, which I assume is the distance between the two circular bases. Since the cylinder is inscribed in the sphere, the sphere must touch the top and bottom faces of the cylinder. So, if I can find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the cylinder, maybe I can find the radius of the sphere.\n\nLet me draw a diagram in my mind. Imagine a sphere with a cylinder inside it. The cylinder is standing upright, so its height is along the vertical diameter of the sphere. The sphere's center is somewhere along this vertical line. The cylinder's radius is 3 cm, so from the center of the cylinder to the top or bottom of the cylinder is 3 cm. The cylinder's height is 8 cm, so from the center of the cylinder to the top is 4 cm, right? Because half of 8 is 4. \n\nSo, if I consider the sphere, its center is somewhere along the vertical line passing through the center of the cylinder.

Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube has 4 layers along each dimension: length, width, and height. So, in total, that's 4\u00d74\u00d74 = 64 unit cubes. Got that down. Now, the problem is asking how many unit cubes remain after removing all those that have at least one face on the exterior.

Hmm, the problem doesn't specify which ones, but I think it's referring to the main diagonals of the cube.\n\nSo, let me clarify: if we have a cube, and we connect the centers of two opposite faces, that's a line that goes through the cube. Similarly, the other line segment connects the centers of another pair of opposite faces. So, we have two such line segments inside the cube. The question is, what's the shortest distance between these two line segments.\n\nI think it would help to assign coordinates to the cube so I can better visualize and compute the distance.

It's being folded along one of its diagonals, and after folding, the two triangular halves form a dihedral angle of 60 degrees. I need to find the distance between the two corners that were originally opposite each other after folding. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. A square has four sides of equal length, so each side is 4 cm. The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. So, the diagonal length would be \u221a(4\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 16) = \u221a32, which simplifies to 4\u221a2 cm. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the square is being folded along one of its diagonals. So, imagine taking the square and folding it along the diagonal, bringing one half over the other. When you fold a square along its diagonal, you end up with two congruent right-angled triangles. But in this case, it's not just folded flat; it's folded so that the two halves form a dihedral angle of 60 degrees. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, so in this case, the angle between the two triangular halves after folding.\n\nSo, before folding, the square is flat, and the two triangles are lying in the same plane. After folding, the dihedral angle between them is 60 degrees, which means the angle between the two planes is 60 degrees. So, the square becomes a three-dimensional shape, kind of like a book that's been opened at an angle.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the distance between the two corners that were originally opposite each other.

Hmm, let me remember what a regular hexagonal prism looks like. It has two congruent regular hexagonal bases connected by rectangular faces. Each of these rectangular faces is called a lateral face, right? So, to find the total surface area, I think I need to calculate the area of the two hexagonal bases and then add the areas of all the rectangular faces.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the surface area of a prism. I think it's the sum of the areas of the two bases plus the lateral surface area. So, if I can find the area of one base and then double it, that should give me the total area for both bases. Then, for the lateral surface area, I need the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism.\n\nBut wait, what exactly is the formula for the area of a regular hexagon?

So, substituting a = 5 cm, the area of one triangle is (\u221a3 / 4) * 5\u00b2 = (\u221a3 / 4) * 25 = (25\u221a3)/4 cm\u00b2.

It says that a plane slices through the midpoints of three edges that share a common vertex, and I need to find the area of the resulting triangular cross-section. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron looks like. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is 4 cm. Now, the problem mentions a plane passing through the midpoints of three edges that share a common vertex. So, if I imagine a vertex where three edges meet, the midpoints of each of those three edges are points along those edges, halfway between the vertex and the opposite vertices.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let's label the tetrahedron's vertices as A, B, C, and D. Suppose the common vertex is A. Then the three edges from A are AB, AC, and AD, each 4 cm long. The midpoints of these edges would be at 2 cm from A. Let's call these midpoints M, N, and P, where M is the midpoint of AB, N is the midpoint of AC, and P is the midpoint of AD.\n\nSo, the plane is passing through points M, N, and P.

A square hole is cut through it, passing through the centers of two opposite faces, and the hole has sides parallel to the cube edges. The area of the hole is 4 cm\u00b2, and I need to find the volume of the remaining solid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the cube. A cube has all sides equal, so each edge is 6 cm. If a square hole is cut through it, passing through the centers of two opposite faces, it means the hole is going straight through the cube from one face to the opposite one. Since the hole is a square, its sides are equal, and the area is given as 4 cm\u00b2. \n\nLet me recall that the area of a square is side length squared. So if the area is 4 cm\u00b2, then the side length of the square hole must be the square root of 4, which is 2 cm. So the hole is a square with sides of 2 cm each.\n\nNow, the hole passes through the centers of two opposite faces. Since the cube has side length 6 cm, the centers of the faces are 3 cm from each edge. So the square hole is centered on both faces it passes through. That makes sense.\n\nI need to figure out how this affects the volume of the remaining solid. Essentially, the cube's original volume minus the volume of the hole that's been removed. So, first, let me calculate the original volume of the cube.\n\nThe volume of a cube is side length cubed, so that's 6 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 6 cm, which is 216 cubic centimeters. Okay, so the cube has a volume of 216 cm\u00b3.\n\nNow, the tricky part is figuring out the volume of the hole. Since the hole is a square prism (a rectangular prism with a square",

I'll start by remembering the basics of polyhedrons and their properties, specifically the number of edges they have.\n\nStarting with the Truncated cube, option A. I know that a cube has 12 edges, right? When you truncate a cube, which means you cut off its corners, each corner is replaced by a new face.

Let me calculate the number of edges here.\n\nA cube has 12 edges. When you truncate each corner, each original edge is divided into three parts, but actually, no, wait.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, when the problem says the spheres are arranged in a cubic pattern where each sphere touches exactly three others, that makes me think of a cube. In a cube, each corner is where three edges meet, so if each sphere is at a corner, each sphere would touch three others. That makes sense. So, the centers of the spheres form the vertices of a cube.\n\nEach sphere has a radius of 2 cm. So, the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres should be twice the radius, right? Because if each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, the distance between centers is the sum of their radii. Since they are identical, it's just 2 + 2 = 4 cm. So, the edge length of the cube is 4 cm.\n\nWait, hold on. If each edge of the cube is 4 cm, then the cube has sides of 4 cm each. But the centers of the spheres are at the vertices of this cube, so the convex hull of the eight sphere centers is just the cube itself. Therefore, the volume of the convex hull would be the volume of this cube.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the volume of a cube.

The pyramid has a rectangular base that's 6 cm by 8 cm, and it has four identical triangular faces. The height of the pyramid is given as 5 cm. Hmm, let me visualize this.

So, I need to calculate both the area of the base and the combined area of all the triangular faces. \n\nStarting with the base, since it's a rectangle, the area is straightforward. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. Here, the length is 8 cm and the width is 6 cm. So, the base area is 8 cm * 6 cm. Let me calculate that: 8 times 6 is 48. So, the base area is 48 square centimeters.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the lateral surface area. Since all four triangular faces are identical, I can calculate the area of one of them and then multiply by four to get the total lateral surface area. Each triangular face is a triangle with a base equal to either 6 cm or 8 cm because the base of the pyramid is 6 cm by 8 cm. But wait, actually, each triangular face has a base that's one of the sides of the rectangle. So, two of the triangular faces will have a base of 6 cm, and the other two will have a base of 8 cm.

So, imagine one cube is the corner where the other two are attached. Let me sketch this mentally: one cube is the corner, and the other two are attached to it, extending in two different directions, forming an L-shape. So, the 3 cm cube is at the corner, and the 4 cm and 5 cm cubes are attached to it, right?\n\nWait, actually, the problem doesn't specify which cube is which size. Hmm, maybe it's arbitrary, but I guess it doesn't really matter as long as I figure out the dimensions correctly. But maybe the way they're arranged affects the surface area? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, actually, the surface area is what determines the amount of wrapping paper needed, right? So, to find the minimum wrapping paper, I need to figure out the total surface area of the L-shaped solid. But wait, if the cubes are glued together, some of their faces are internal, so those shouldn't be counted towards the surface area.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Each cube has 6 faces. The 3 cm cube has a surface area of 6*(3^2) = 54 cm\u00b2. The 4 cm cube has 6*(4^2) = 96 cm\u00b2, and the 5 cm cube has 6*(5^2) = 150 cm\u00b2.

They intersect each other such that their axes are perpendicular and they pass through each other's centers. I need to find the volume of their intersection. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a hexagonal prism is. A regular hexagonal prism has two congruent hexagonal bases connected by rectangular faces. The side length of the hexagon is 2 cm, and the height of the prism is 8 cm. So, each prism is like a hexagonal box that's 8 cm tall.\n\nNow, the problem says the prisms intersect each other with their axes perpendicular. I think this means that if one prism's axis is along the x-axis, the other prism's axis is along the y-axis, or something like that. But since they are both regular hexagonal prisms, their axes are the lines connecting the centers of their hexagonal bases. So, if they pass through each other's centers, that means the centers of the two prisms coincide at the same point.\n\nWait, no, actually, the axes are perpendicular and pass through each other's centers.

Now, the cube has 12 edges, right? Each edge is 1 unit long.\n\nThe problem says the cube is being cut by a plane that passes through two opposite edges. Hmm, opposite edges. So, in a cube, opposite edges are edges that don't intersect and aren't adjacent. Since each edge has a corresponding opposite edge, I guess. Let me think. For example, in the top face of the cube, each edge has an opposite edge on the bottom face. So, if I take an edge on the top face, its opposite edge would be the one directly below it on the bottom face.\n\nSo, if a plane passes through two opposite edges, it must pass through these two edges that are parallel and not intersecting.

But I need to figure out the exact shape and then calculate its area.\n\nLet me try to sketch this mentally. Let's consider a cube with coordinates. Maybe it's easier to assign coordinates to the cube's vertices to make it more concrete. Let's place the cube in a 3D coordinate system where one corner is at the origin (0,0,0), and the opposite corner is at (1,1,1).

I think a cube can project a regular hexagon. If you position the cube so that one of its space diagonals is aligned with the light source, the shadow cast on the plane perpendicular to that diagonal should be a regular hexagon. Each face of the cube is a square, and when viewed along the space diagonal, the projection should indeed form a regular hexagon because all sides and angles would appear equal.

The cube has right angles, so I'm not immediately sure if such a projection is possible. Let me think.

What is the total surface area of the cube?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: A diagonal of a cube has length 6\u221a3 cm. What is the total surface area of the cube? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a cube, all sides are equal, right? So, if I can find the length of one edge, I can figure out the surface area. The problem gives me the length of a diagonal, which isn't the edge but rather the space diagonal of the cube. I think the space diagonal of a cube can be related to the edge length using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.\n\nLet me recall, the space diagonal (d) of a cube with edge length (a) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ d = a\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nIs that right? Yeah, I think so. Because in a cube, the space diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with one edge and the face diagonal. The face diagonal itself can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions, which is \\( a\\sqrt{2} \\), and then the space diagonal is the hypotenuse of another right triangle where the other two sides are the edge and the face diagonal. So, it's \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + (a\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + 2a^2} = \\sqrt{3a^2} = a\\sqrt{3} \\). Got it.\n\nSo, given that the space diagonal is 6\u221a3 cm, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ a\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nTo find the edge length (a), I can divide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\nSimplifying that, the \u221a3 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, so:\n\n",

I need to find the radius of the sphere that passes through all four vertices of the tetrahedron. Hmm, that sphere is called the circumscribed sphere or the circumsphere, right? I think the center of this sphere is called the circumcenter of the tetrahedron. \n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a regular tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so every edge is 6 cm in this case. Since all edges are equal, it's highly symmetrical, which should help in finding the circumradius.\n\nI remember that for regular polyhedrons, there are formulas relating edge lengths to various radii, like the circumradius, inradius, etc. But I don't remember the exact formula for a tetrahedron. Maybe I can derive it? Or perhaps I can use some coordinate geometry.\n\nLet me try to visualize a regular tetrahedron. It has four vertices, and all are equidistant from the center of the sphere. If I can find the coordinates of the four vertices, I can find the center of the sphere by solving equations, and then compute the radius.\n\nYes, that sounds like a plan. Let me set up a coordinate system. To make things symmetric, I can position one vertex along the z-axis, and position the base in the xy-plane. But wait, in 3D space, how exactly?\n\nI think the standard way is to place one vertex at (0, 0, 0), and then the other three vertices in such a way that all edges are equal.

But a hexagon is a six-sided figure, so maybe when you fold it, each side becomes a face? But that might not make sense because a cube has six faces but each face is a square, not a hexagon.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a triangular pyramid?

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you rotate a shape around an axis, it creates a three-dimensional object. In this case, an equilateral triangle is being rotated around one of its sides. I think this might create a kind of a cone or something similar. Let me visualize it.\n\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal, so each side is 4 units long. If I rotate it around one of its sides, the opposite vertex will trace out a circular path. That should form a cone. So, the side we're rotating around is the height of the cone, and the opposite vertex is the tip. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, when you rotate a triangle around one of its sides, the side becomes the axis of rotation. The opposite vertex is the point that's not on the axis, so when you spin it, it creates a circle. So, that opposite vertex is at a certain height from the axis, which will become the radius of the base of the cone. The side we're rotating around is the height of the cone, right? So, to find the volume, I need to figure out the radius and the height of the cone.\n\nWait, hold on. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. So, if I have a triangle with side length 4, and I want to find its height, I can use the formula for the height of an equilateral triangle. The formula is (sqrt(3)/2) times the side length. So, the height h is (sqrt(3)/2)*4, which is 2*sqrt(3). So, h = 2*sqrt(3). \n\nBut wait, when I rotate the triangle around one of its sides",

So, the sphere touches the cone from the inside. I need to find the ratio of the height (h) of the cone to the radius (r) of its base when the cone has the minimum possible volume.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling some formulas. The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, right? So, I need to express this volume in terms of one variable and then find its minimum. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cone, there must be a relationship between the dimensions of the cone and the sphere.\n\nLet me think about the geometry here. If the sphere is inscribed in the cone, it must be tangent to the cone along a circle. That means the sphere touches the cone's side at exactly one point, and also touches the base of the cone. Wait, actually, does it touch the base? Or does it just touch the lateral surface? Hmm, I think it touches the lateral surface and the base.

I need to find the ratio of the height (h) of the cone to the radius (r) of its base when the cone has the minimum possible volume.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]\n\n[\"adding-knowledge\"]Alright, let's start by recalling some formulas. The volume of a cone is given by (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, right? So, I need to express this volume in terms of one variable and then find its minimum. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cone, there must be a relationship between the dimensions of the cone and the sphere.[\"end-section\"][\"adding-knowledge\"]\n\n[\"deduction\"]Let me think about the geometry here. If the sphere is inscribed in the cone, it must be tangent to the cone along a circle. That means the sphere touches the cone's side at exactly one point, and also touches the base of the cone. Wait, actually, does it touch the base? Or does it just touch the lateral surface? Hmm, I think it touches the lateral surface and the base. Because if it's inscribed, it should be tangent to the cone's lateral surface and also tangent to the base.[\"end-section\"][\"deduction\"]\n\n[\"example-testing\"]So, let me try to draw a cross-sectional view of this.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a cuboctahedron is a polyhedron that has 8 triangular faces and 6 square faces. It's like a cube that's been cut at each corner, right? So, if we start with a cube, truncating each corner would mean cutting off each of the 8 vertices. The problem says we're cutting each corner to the midpoints of the adjacent edges. That probably means that each corner is cut exactly halfway along each edge that meets at that corner.\n\nSince the original cube has an edge length of 4, each edge is 4 units long. If we're cutting each corner to the midpoints, then on each edge, we're cutting off a segment of length 2, right? Because halfway along a 4-unit edge is 2 units. So, each original edge of the cube will be truncated by 2 units on each end.\n\nWait, but does that mean that each original edge is reduced by 4 units in total? Because if we cut 2 units off each end, the remaining length would be 4 - 2 - 2 = 0. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me visualize this.\n\nActually, when you truncate a cube's corner, you're removing a small octahedral part from each corner. Each corner is a right angle, and cutting it off at the midpoints of the edges would create a new triangular face in place of each corner.\n\nSo, each original edge of the cube will be split into a middle segment and two truncated segments.

I need to find the distance from the origin to the farthest point on the box. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the distance from a point to another point in 3D space can be found using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} \\]\n\nIn this case, the origin is the point (0, 0, 0), and the farthest point on the box will be one of its vertices.

I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron formed by connecting the centers of these four spheres. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, when the problem says each sphere touches exactly three others, that makes me think of a tetrahedral arrangement. In a tetrahedron, each vertex is connected to three others, so that fits. So, the centers of the four spheres must form a regular tetrahedron. That makes sense because if all spheres have the same radius, the distances between their centers should be equal. So, the edges of the tetrahedron should all be the same length.\n\nNow, each sphere has a radius of 2 cm. So, the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres should be twice the radius, right? Because if two spheres each have a radius of 2 cm, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii, which is 2 + 2 = 4 cm. So, each edge of the tetrahedron is 4 cm long.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? If each sphere touches three others, does that mean the distance between centers is twice the radius? Let me think. If each sphere has a radius of 2 cm, then yes, when they touch each other, the distance between their centers is 2 * radius = 4 cm. So, the edge length of the tetrahedron is 4 cm.\n\nSo, now I need to find the volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length 4 cm.

Let me try to visualize this step by step. The original cube has an edge length of 10 cm, and we're cutting off each corner by cutting 2 cm from each corner along each edge. Hmm, truncating the corners... that should create new faces where the corners used to be.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a cube has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. When we truncate each corner, we're essentially cutting off each of these vertices. Each corner is where three edges meet, right? So, if we cut off a corner, the cut will create a new face where that corner used to be. Since each corner is a meeting point of three edges, the new face created should be a triangle, assuming the cut is made equally along each edge.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. If I cut off a corner by 2 cm along each edge, that means each original edge will have a portion removed from both ends. So, each original edge of 10 cm will now be shorter. Specifically, if I cut off 2 cm from each end, the remaining length of each original edge should be 10 - 2*2 = 6 cm. So, each original edge is now 6 cm long.\n\nBut how does this affect the number of faces? Each corner truncation adds a new face. Since there are 8 corners on a cube, truncating each corner should add 8 new triangular faces. So, that's 8 new faces.\n\nNow, what about the original faces? The original cube had 6 square faces. After truncation, each original face will have its corners cut off.

A third plane intersects both of these planes along parallel lines. I need to find the angle between the third plane and each of the original planes. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me recall some basic concepts. When two planes intersect, they form a dihedral angle, which is the angle between them.

So, the third plane is cutting through the two original planes in such a way that the lines of intersection are parallel. Interesting.\n\nI think it might help to draw a diagram or use some coordinate system to model this.

The cube has a side length of 10 cm, and the hole is a cylinder with a radius of 2 cm. I need to find the volume of the remaining solid after the cylinder has been removed. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with volumes, it's often helpful to calculate the volume of the original object and then subtract the volume of the part that's been removed. In this case, the original object is a cube, and the removed part is a cylinder. So, the remaining volume should be the cube's volume minus the cylinder's volume. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nSo, the cube has a side length of 10 cm. I know that the volume of a cube is calculated by side length cubed. So, the volume of the cube is 10^3, which is 1000 cubic centimeters. Got that down. Now, for the cylinder that's been drilled out. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0 times radius squared times height, right? The radius is given as 2 cm. But wait, what's the height of the cylinder? The problem says it's drilled from the center of one face to the center of the opposite face. Since the cube has side length 10 cm, that means the height of the cylinder must be equal to the side length of the cube, which is 10 cm. So, plugging in the numbers, the volume of the cylinder is \u03c0*(2)^2*10. Let me compute that: 2 squared is 4, times 10 is 40, so 40\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the remaining solid should be the cube's volume minus the cylinder's volume, which is 1000 minus 40\u03c0.

The options are regular hexagon, square, equilateral triangle, and regular pentagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that cross-sections of cubes can create various polygons depending on how you slice them. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, a square. If I slice a cube straight across, parallel to one of its faces, the cross-section is obviously a square. That's straightforward. So, square is definitely possible.\n\nNext, an equilateral triangle. Hmm, how would I get an equilateral triangle from a cube? I know that a cross-section can be a triangle if I slice through three non-adjacent vertices. But wait, in a cube, any three non-adjacent vertices would form a triangle, but is it equilateral? Let me visualize a cube. If I connect three vertices that are diagonally opposite on different faces, maybe? Wait, no, that might not give an equilateral triangle. Maybe if I slice through three edges? Hmm, actually, I'm not sure. Maybe it's possible if I slice through three edges that are equally spaced. I think it is possible, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, another thought: if I take a cube and slice it from one corner to the opposite corner on the top face, then from that corner to another opposite corner on the bottom face, and then another, that might form an equilateral triangle. But I'm not entirely sure if all sides would be equal. Maybe the distances would be the same because of the cube's symmetry.

They're placed in such a way that each sphere touches exactly four others. I need to find the volume of the convex hull of the centers of these six spheres. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup. Each sphere has a radius of 1 cm, so the centers of the spheres must be at least 2 cm apart from each other because each sphere touches its neighbors. If each sphere touches four others, that suggests that each center is connected to four others. So, I'm thinking this must form some kind of three-dimensional shape where each vertex (sphere center) is connected to four others. \n\nWait, in three-dimensional space, how many edges can a single vertex have? Well, in a tetrahedron, each vertex is connected to three others, so that's not enough. If I go to a cube, each vertex is connected to three others as well. Hmm. Maybe it's an octahedron? Let me think. An octahedron has six vertices, each connected to four others. Yes, that sounds right. So, the centers of the six spheres form an octahedron. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Is it a regular octahedron? A regular octahedron is a Platonic solid with eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. Each vertex is connected to four others, so that fits. So, if the centers form a regular octahedron, then the distance between each center is the same, which would be twice the radius, so 2 cm, since each sphere has a radius of 1 cm.\n\nSo, the distance between centers is 2 cm. Therefore, the edge length of the octahedron is 2 cm. Now, I need to find the volume",

What is the volume of the torus?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find the volume of a torus. Hmm, a torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. Let me recall the formula for the volume of a torus. I think it's something involving \u03c0 and the radii involved. \n\nWait, the problem says the torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 cm around an axis that's 7 cm from the center of the circle. So, I guess the circle has a radius of 3 cm, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 7 cm. \n\nI remember that the volume of a torus can be calculated using the formula V = 2\u03c0\u00b2Rr\u00b2, where R is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation, and r is the radius of the circle being rotated. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right because when you rotate a circle around an axis, you're essentially creating a sort of cylinder with a circular cross-section, but since it's hollow, you have to account for the entire area being swept out by the circle.\n\nSo in this case, R is 7 cm, and r is 3 cm. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. That would be 2 times \u03c0 squared times 7 squared times 3 squared. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 7 squared is 49, and 3 squared is 9. So, 49 times 9 is... let me calculate that. 49 times 9, well 40 times 9 is 360, and 9 times 9 is 81, so 360 plus 81 is 441. So, 49 times 9 is 441. \n\nThen, I need to multiply that by \u03c0 squared.

The base has a side length of 4 cm, and the pyramid has a height of 8 cm. I need to find the total surface area of the pyramid. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the surface area of a pyramid is the sum of the base area and the lateral (the sides) area. So, I need to figure out both the area of the base and the area of all the triangular faces.\n\nStarting with the base, it's a regular hexagon with each side 4 cm. I recall that the formula for the area of a regular hexagon is \\((\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\text{side length}^2)\\). Let me write that down:\n\nBase area = \\((\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 4^2)\\).\n\nCalculating that, 4 squared is 16, so:\n\nBase area = \\((\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 16)\\).\n\nMultiplying 16 by 3 gives 48, so:\n\nBase area = \\(\\frac{48\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nDividing 48 by 2 is 24, so the base area is \\(24\\sqrt{3}\\) cm\u00b2. Got that down.\n\nNow, moving on to the lateral surface area. A pyramid with a hexagonal base has six triangular faces. Since it's a regular pyramid, all these triangles should be congruent, right?

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you look at a cube from a corner viewpoint, you can see three faces of the cube. Since it's a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube, each face has 25 unit cubes. But of course, when you look at it, you can't see all 25 of those because some are blocked by others. So, how many can you actually see?\n\nI think it's related to the concept of the visible cubes when looking at a 3D object. For a cube, from a corner view, you can see three faces. But the problem is overlapping, right? The cubes along the edges and corners where the faces meet are counted in more than one face, so we have to make sure we don't double count them.\n\nSo, let me break it down. Each face has 5\u00d75 = 25 cubes. If I have three faces, that would be 25\u00d73 = 75, but obviously, that's way more than the total number of cubes, which is 125. So, that can't be right.

Hmm, okay. I need to figure out which Platonic solid is dual to a regular dodecahedron.

They have a sort of symmetry where each face of one corresponds to a vertex of the other, and vice versa. So, if I can remember the duals of the common Platonic solids, that might help.\n\nLet me list out the Platonic solids and their duals. I think:\n\n- The dual of a Tetrahedron is another Tetrahedron.\n- The dual of a Cube is an Octahedron.\n- The dual of an Octahedron is a Cube.\n- The dual of an Icosahedron is a Dodecahedron.\n- The dual of a Dodecahedron is an Icosahedron.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then a regular dodecahedron should be dual to an icosahedron. So the answer should be B) Icosahedron. Hmm, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.\n\nAnother way to think about it is by the number of faces, edges, and vertices. I remember that for dual polyhedrons, the number of vertices on one corresponds to the number of faces on the other, and the number of edges remains the same.

The cube has a vertex at the origin, and the three edges from that vertex go along the positive x, y, and z axes. Hmm, let me visualize this. The cube is sitting with one corner at (0,0,0), and the opposite face would be the one that's diagonally across from it. That face is a square, right? So, the plane that contains this face should be the one that's opposite to the origin, meaning it's not touching the origin.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to find the equation of a plane. The general equation of a plane is ax + by + cz + d = 0, where a, b, c, and d are constants, and a, b, c can't all be zero. Alternatively, I can use the plane equation in intercept form, which is x/a + y/b + z/c = 1, where a, b, c are the intercepts on the x, y, and z axes, respectively.\n\nSince the cube has a side length of 6 cm, the edges along the axes from the origin are each 6 cm long. That means the opposite face will be at (6,0,0), (0,6,0), and (0,0,6). Wait, actually, no. The opposite face is the one that's not containing the origin, so it's the face that's 6 units away along each axis. So, the opposite face would be the square in the plane where x=6, y=6, or z=6? No, actually, each face is defined by one coordinate being constant. Since the origin is at (0,0,0), the opposite face would be the face that doesn't include the origin, so it's the face where x=",

It says it has an equilateral triangular base with a side length of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. I need to find the total length of all the edges of the prism. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a triangular prism looks like. It's like a box but with triangular bases instead of square ones. So, it has two congruent triangles on the top and bottom, and three rectangles connecting them. Each of these rectangles is a lateral face of the prism.\n\nNow, the problem mentions an equilateral triangular base with side length 4 cm. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal, so each side is 4 cm. The height of the prism is 10 cm. I think the height of the prism is the distance between the two triangular bases, right? So, the length, width, and height of the prism are important here.\n\nWait, hold on. In a triangular prism, the height is usually the perpendicular distance between the two bases. So, if the base is an equilateral triangle with side length 4 cm, then the base is a 4 cm by 4 cm by 4 cm triangle. The height of the prism, which is 10 cm, is the length that goes from one base to the other, perpendicular to the base.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total length of all the edges. So, I need to figure out how many edges there are and their individual lengths.\n\nA triangular prism has 9 edges in total. Let me break that down. On each triangular base, there are 3 edges. Since there are two bases, that's 3 times 2, which is 6 edges. Then, there are 3 more edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the two bases, which are the height edges of the prism. So,",

That should be useful here. Similarity means that the ratios of their corresponding dimensions are equal. So, if I can figure out the height of the original cone and the height of the smaller, cut-off cone, I can find the height of the frustum by subtracting the two.\n\nLet me visualize this.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a regular tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so every edge is 6 cm. That means each face is an equilateral triangle with sides of 6 cm.\n\nNow, the tetrahedron is placed on a horizontal surface with exactly one face on the surface. So, one of its faces is completely lying flat on the ground, and the opposite vertex is the one that's sticking up. I need to find the height of this top vertex from the ground.\n\nI think the height of the tetrahedron from the base to the top vertex is called the \"height\" of the tetrahedron. Wait, but actually, in a regular tetrahedron, the height is the perpendicular distance from one vertex to the opposite face. So, if the tetrahedron is placed on a surface, the height from the base (which is on the surface) to the top vertex is the same as the height of the tetrahedron.\n\nBut I should double-check that. If the tetrahedron is placed on a surface with one face down, the height from the base to the apex is indeed the same as the height of the tetrahedron. So, maybe I can calculate the height of the tetrahedron and that will be the answer.\n\nTo find the height (h) of a regular tetrahedron, I can use the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron, which is h = (sqrt(6)/3) * edge length. Let me verify that formula.\n\nThe height (h) of",

The question is asking which number is on the face opposite to the face labeled 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize a cube. A cube has six faces, right? And each face is a square. Now, each pair of opposite faces adds up to 7. That means if one face is labeled 1, the opposite face must be 6, because 1 + 6 = 7. Similarly, if one face is 2, the opposite face would be 5, and if one face is 3, the opposite face would be 4. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check. If opposite faces sum to 7, then each pair must consist of two numbers that add up to 7. So, the pairs should be (1,6), (2,5), and (3,4). That seems right because 1+6=7, 2+5=7, and 3+4=7. So each of these pairs are opposite each other.\n\nNow, the cube has three pairs of opposite faces. So, if one face is 3, the opposite face must be 4 because 3+4=7.

Let me pick vertex A as the one around which the rotation is happening. The axis is passing through A and is perpendicular to the diagonal through A. So, the diagonal in question is from A to the opposite vertex, which would be C, right? Because in a square, the diagonals are AC and BD.\n\nSo, the axis is passing through A and is perpendicular to diagonal AC. That means the axis is not along the diagonal AC but is perpendicular to it at point A. So, if diagonal AC is going from A to C, the axis is like a line sticking out from A, perpendicular to AC. Let me imagine that. So, in 3D space, if I have the square lying flat, say on the xy-plane, with A at the origin, then the diagonal AC would be along the line y = x, assuming the square is aligned that way. Then the axis would be perpendicular to AC, so that would be the y-axis or the x-axis? Wait, if the diagonal AC is at 45 degrees from the x and y-axes, then a line perpendicular to AC at A would be along the direction of either the negative y-axis or positive y-axis or negative x-axis or positive x-axis?

The fold is done in such a way that one corner touches the opposite corner. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch this out mentally. I have a rectangle, 8 cm by 12 cm. Let me assume it's placed with the longer sides along the horizontal, so the rectangle is 12 cm wide and 8 cm tall. Now, the problem says it's folded so that one corner touches the opposite corner. So, for example, if I take the top right corner and fold it down to touch the bottom left corner. That should create a crease or a fold line, and the area I need to find is the quadrilateral formed by this fold line and the three remaining edges of the paper.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Folding a corner to the opposite corner... That sounds like a diagonal fold, but not along the diagonal itself. Because if it were along the diagonal, it would just be the diagonal line, but the fold is along another line that causes the corner to meet the opposite corner.\n\nMaybe it's a reflection? When you fold a point over a line, it reflects that point across that line. So, if I fold the paper such that the top right corner meets the bottom left, the fold line would be the perpendicular bisector of the diagonal connecting those two corners. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nLet me denote the rectangle as ABCD, with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left.

What is the height of the pyramid?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a pyramid. It says it has a square base with a side length of 6 cm, and each lateral edge is 10 cm long. I need to find the height of the pyramid. Hmm, let me visualize this. A pyramid with a square base means it's a square-based pyramid, right? So, it's not a triangular pyramid or anything like that. The base is a square, each side of the base is 6 cm, and the edges from the base to the apex (the top point of the pyramid) are each 10 cm.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the height of this pyramid. The height is the perpendicular distance from the apex straight down to the center of the base. I remember that in pyramids, if it's a right pyramid, the apex is directly above the center of the base. Since it doesn't specify otherwise, I think we can assume it's a right pyramid, so that should help.\n\nFirst, maybe I should draw a diagram to get a better idea. Let me sketch a square base with side length 6 cm. Then, from the center of the square, I can draw a vertical line, which will be the height of the pyramid, and from the center to each corner of the square, that distance is half of the diagonal of the base.\n\nWait, let me think about the diagonal of the base. Since the base is a square with side length 6 cm, the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonal of a square splits it into two right-angled triangles, each with legs of 6 cm. So, the diagonal length is sqrt(6^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(36 + 36) = sqrt(72). Simplify sqrt(72): that's 6*sqrt(2) cm. So, half of that diagonal would be 3*sqrt(2) cm. So",

That means the plane is slicing through the cylinder along that diameter. But it's also tangent to the bottom base. Tangent means it just touches the bottom base at one point.\n\nHmm, so the plane is cutting the cylinder in such a way that it goes through the top diameter and just touches the bottom without intersecting it elsewhere.

I need to find the distance between the centers of any two touching spheres. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst off, four spheres each touching three others. That makes me think of a tetrahedron, right? Because a tetrahedron has four vertices, and each vertex is connected to the other three. So, if each sphere touches three others, their centers must form a tetrahedron. Cool, so the centers are at the vertices of a tetrahedron.\n\nNow, what kind of tetrahedron is this? Well, since all the spheres have the same radius, the tetrahedron must be regular. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal in length, and all faces are equilateral triangles. So, the distance between any two centers should be the same. That distance is what I'm trying to find.\n\nEach sphere has a radius of 3 cm, so the distance between any two centers should be twice the radius, right? Wait, hold on. If two spheres each with radius 3 cm touch each other, the distance between their centers should be the sum of their radii. But since both have the same radius, that would be 3 + 3 = 6 cm. So, the edge length of the tetrahedron is 6 cm. Is that all there is to it?\n\nHmm, maybe. Let me think again. So, if each sphere touches three others, and they're all the same size, the centers form a regular tetrahedron where each edge is 6 cm. So, the distance between any two centers is 6 cm. That seems straightforward, but I feel like I might be missing something.\n\nWait, is the tetrahedron the only possible configuration? Could there be",

I need to find the total surface area of the solid. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the solid. It's like a cylinder with a hemisphere attached on top of its base. So, the cylinder has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 8 cm. The hemisphere also has a radius of 5 cm because it's attached along its circular base. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is about surface area. So, I need to find the total surface area of this combined solid. Let's recall that surface area of a solid is the sum of the surface areas of all its faces. But since it's a composite shape, I need to make sure I don't double-count any areas where they are joined together.\n\nLet me recall the formulas I'll need. The surface area of a cylinder is given by 2\u03c0r\u00b2 + 2\u03c0rh, where r is the radius and h is the height. The surface area of a hemisphere is half the surface area of a full sphere, so it's (2\u03c0r\u00b2)(1/2) = \u03c0r\u00b2. However, when the hemisphere is attached to the cylinder, the circular base of the hemisphere is glued to the top of the cylinder's base, so that part isn't exposed. So, I need to subtract the area of that base from the hemisphere's surface area.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I get that right.

The icosahedron has 20 triangular faces and each edge is 3 cm long. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how to approach this, but I remember something about regular polyhedrons and their properties.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an icosahedron is. It's one of the Platonic solids, right? It has 20 triangular faces, 12 vertices, and 30 edges. Each face is an equilateral triangle, and all the edges are the same length, which is given as 3 cm here. The question is asking for the distance from the center to a vertex, which is also known as the radius of the circumscribed sphere or the circumradius.\n\nI think the formula for the circumradius of a regular icosahedron might involve some trigonometric functions. I remember that for a regular polyhedron, the circumradius can be calculated if you know the edge length. But I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe I can derive it or look up the formula.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the geometry of the icosahedron. I remember that it can be related to the golden ratio.

It's positioned with one vertex at the origin, and the edges are along the positive coordinate axes. So, that means the cube is sitting with its edges along the x, y, and z-axes, and it's a unit cube, so each edge is 1 unit long.

Hmm, cross-sections of cubes can be tricky, but I think if I can figure out the shape of the intersection, I can find the area.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cube. Since it's a unit cube, the opposite vertex from the origin would be at (1,1,1). The plane x + y + z = 2 intersects the cube somewhere. I think the cross-section will be a polygon, probably a triangle or a quadrilateral or something like that.\n\nTo figure out the shape, I need to find where the plane intersects the edges of the cube. The cube has 12 edges, but the plane might only intersect some of them. Let me think about how the plane x + y + z = 2 cuts through the cube.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a unit cube, the edges go from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), and so on for all combinations. Each edge is along one of the axes.\n\nSo, the plane x + y + z = 2 will intersect the cube where the sum of the coordinates is 2.

The equal sides of these isosceles triangles are 10 cm each. I need to find the volume of this pyramid.\n\nAlright, let me start by visualizing the pyramid. The base is an equilateral triangle, so all three sides are 8 cm. The other three faces are isosceles triangles, each with two sides of 10 cm and one side that's 8 cm. So, each of these triangles is attached to one side of the base. That makes sense.\n\nTo find the volume of a pyramid, I remember the formula is (1/3) * base area * height. So, I need to figure out the area of the base and the height of the pyramid. The base is an equilateral triangle, so that part should be straightforward.

How many faces does the resulting solid have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I came across this geometry problem today, and it's about modifying a cube. The cube has an edge length of 4 cm, and each corner is cut off by planes that pass through points which divide each edge in a 1:3 ratio, starting from each vertex. The question is asking how many faces the resulting solid will have. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a plane to cut off a corner of a cube. When you cut off a corner of a cube, you're essentially truncating it, which means you're replacing that corner with a new face. So, each corner that's cut off will add a new triangular face to the cube. Since a cube has 8 corners, I might initially think that we're adding 8 new triangular faces. But wait, maybe it's more complicated than that because the planes are cutting through multiple edges, not just one.\n\nThe problem says the planes pass through points that divide each edge in a 1:3 ratio starting from each vertex. So, each edge is 4 cm long, and we're cutting it at a point that's 1/4 of the way from each vertex. That means on each edge, the plane cuts off a small portion near the vertex, right? So, for each edge, there will be a triangular face where the corner used to be.\n\nBut hold on, each corner is shared by three edges. So, if I cut each edge 1/4 from each vertex, the plane cutting off the corner will intersect the three edges meeting at that corner. Therefore, each corner is replaced by a triangular face. Since each triangular face is formed by connecting these three points of intersection on the edges, each corner's truncation adds one face.\n\nSo, if there are 8 corners, that would suggest 8 triangular faces.
